<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>There are many interesting and characteristic
incidents in the domestic life of Luther
which are not found in biographies of the great
Reformer. The character of his wife has not
been portrayed in full, and who does not wish
to become better acquainted with a woman who
mingled many a drop of balsam in those numerous
cups of sorrow which her celebrated
husband was compelled to drink?</p>
<p>This little book is the result of extensive
research, and exhibits facts attested by the
most reliable authorities, many of which will be
new to those of my readers who have not investigated
this particular subject.</p>

<p class="h2sum">Clerical Celibacy&mdash;Luther-Bernhardi&rsquo;s Marriage&mdash;Treatment
of Catharine de Bora&mdash;the Convent&mdash;Wealthy
Nuns&mdash;Convent Life&mdash;the Escape&mdash;Treatment of the
Nuns&mdash;Florentine de Oberweimer&mdash;Leonard Koppe&mdash;Luther&rsquo;s
Defence.</p>
<p>The celibacy of the clergy was one of the
strongest pillars on which the proud edifice of
Romish power rested. It was a stupendous
partition-wall which separated the clergy from
all other interests, and thus consolidated the
wide-spread authority of the Pope. It cut off
the secular clergy, as well as the monks, from
all domestic ties. They forgot father, mother,
and friends. Political obligations to their
sovereign and country were disregarded, but
the cord which bound them to the interests of
Rome was only the more tightly drawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Superior purity was the presumed ground of
the system, but a total surrender of all rights,
and complete submission to the will of the Pope,
were its legitimate results. He was regarded
as the only parent of the clergy&mdash;the only
sovereign to whom they owed allegiance&mdash;the
only protector in whom they were to confide,
and, as dutiful sons, obedient subjects, and
grateful beneficiaries, they were obliged to exert
themselves to the utmost to maintain his
authority and extend his dominion. Clerical
celibacy was regarded not only as a duty, but
as the highest attainment in moral perfection.
The system was introduced with caution and
maintained with sleepless vigilance and zeal.
There were some who saw its errors and disadvantages,
and desired its abolition, but their
remonstrances were unheeded and their clamors
silenced.</p>
<p>That, however, which was considered impossible
by the whole Christian world, was accomplished
by a single man, who himself had been
a monk, and whose first duty as such was a
vow of celibacy! That man was <span class="sc">Martin
Luther</span>, Augustinian Monk, Doctor of Theology
at the University of Wittenberg, who, by his
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
heroic conduct in relation to this subject, has
only added to the other inappreciable services
he has rendered the Church. It was he who
was bold enough to abandon the monastic order,
and, in spite of the principles of the Church as
they prevailed in that age, <i>to enter the married
state</i>. This adventurous step led to the deliverance
of a large portion of the clergy from the
chain of Papal power. From having been the
slavish satellites of a foreign master in Italy,
they became patriotic subjects and useful men
at home.</p>
<p>Several years before, two friends of Luther,
who were his noble assistants in the work of
the Reformation, Melanchthon and Carlstadt,
had written treatises against clerical celibacy.
Their books on this subject were equally as
unexpected, and created as much excitement
among the clergy, as Luther&rsquo;s Theses against
Indulgences had done six years before.</p>
<p>Luther was not the first priest of those days
who practically rejected celibacy. As early as
1521, one of his friends and fellow-laborers,
Bernhardi, superintendent of the churches at
Kemberg, had the boldness to marry. He was
the first ecclesiastic in Saxony who took this
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
step, and his wedding-day was long regarded as
the <i>Pastors&rsquo; Emancipation Day</i>; but Caspar
Aquila, a priest residing near Augsburg, was
married as early as 1516, Jacob Knabe in
1518, and Nicolas Brunner in 1519.</p>
<p>Luther was free from all participation in
Bernhardi&rsquo;s marriage, for at that time he was a
prisoner in Wartburg Castle, and the first
intelligence came so unexpectedly, that whilst
he admired the courage of his friend, he was
very apprehensive it would occasion him and
his cause many severe trials. Not long after,
Bernhardi&rsquo;s metropolitan, the Cardinal Archbishop
Albert, of Mainz and Magdeburg,
demanded of the Elector of Saxony, Frederick
the Wise, to send Bernhardi to Halle, to answer
for his presumptuous act. Frederick did not
yield to the demand of the Archbishop, and
the latter professed to be satisfied with an
anonymous defence of Bernhardi.</p>
<p>Luther himself sent a petition to Albert in
behalf of the clergy who had already married
and of those who intended to marry. Subsequently,
however, Bernhardi suffered severely.
When, in 1547, more than twenty years after
his nuptials, the Emperor Charles V. captured
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Wittenberg, his savage Spaniards seized Bernhardi,
and bound him fast to a table. His wife
rescued him from their murderous hands; but,
soon after, others laid hold of him, and after
cruelly beating him, tied him to a horse and
dragged him to the camp at Torgau. A German
officer, after much trouble, had him
liberated, and he finally, after unexampled
suffering, reached his family at Kemberg. A
considerable number of priests followed the
example of Bernhardi. They were not deterred
by the ban of the bishops, nor by the fear of
deposition and imprisonment. But all this
would not have created such immense excitement
if Luther himself, to whom all eyes were
directed, had not resolved, by his own example,
to strike a deadly blow at priestly celibacy.</p>
<p>Catharine de Bora, a nun of the celebrated
Bernhardin or Cistercian convent at Nimtschen,
in Saxony, was the person whom Luther chose
as his wife. She was born on the 29th of
January, 1499. There is no authentic record
of the place of her birth, and the history of
her childhood is wrapped in obscurity. It is
only as the nun Catharine that we first became
acquainted with her. Her Romish calumniators
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
(and no innocent woman was ever more bitterly
and cruelly defamed,) declare that her parents
compelled her to become a nun against her will,
because they were poor and could not support
her, and particularly because her conduct was
so objectionable that her seclusion was necessary.
As regards the first, it is true; she was
not wealthy when she became the wife of
Luther; but, if she had been compelled to enter
the nunnery, it is likely that Luther would
have mentioned it as an additional justification
of her flight. Her objectionable morality is
based by her enemies on the fact of her escape,
and hence the accusation has no ground whatever.
There is not a particle of proof to
establish the calumnious charge.</p>
<p>This Convent was designated by the name of
<i>The Throne of God</i>. It was founded in 1250
by Henry the Illustrious. No trace of it
remains at the present day. In 1810-12 its
ruins were removed to make room for the erection
of an edifice connected with a school for
boys established at that place.</p>
<p>Most of the inmates of this Convent were of
noble birth, for at that day, as well as at
present, it was the policy and interest of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Romish clergy to induce as many ladies of high
rank as possible to take the veil, thereby rendering
the profession respectable, and securing
large sums as entrance fees if they were wealthy,
and all their patrimony after their decease.</p>
<p>It may seem strange that Catharine de Bora,
who, according to her own confession, was
devout, industrious in the discharge of conventual
duties, and diligent in prayer, should
have determined with eight other &ldquo;sisters&rdquo; to
escape from their prison. But when it is considered
that the convent was situated within the
territory of the Elector Frederick the Wise,
who was Luther&rsquo;s friend and patron&mdash;that
Luther himself visited a neighboring monastery
at Grimma as Inspector&mdash;that in 1519, after
the dispute with Eck at Leipzig, he spent a few
days in the town of Nimtschen&mdash;that the
principles of the Reformation had already made
some progress in that vicinity, and that several
monasteries not far distant had been abandoned&mdash;the
circumstance is easily explained. It is
scarcely credible that amid the excitement of
the times, no word of Luther&rsquo;s doctrine should
have entered the convent halls, and that the
stirring events occurring around them should
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
have been entirely concealed from the unobtrusive
occupants. Could not some of those
courageous friends of Luther, who afterwards,
at his suggestion, effected the escape of the
nuns, have previously introduced some of
Luther&rsquo;s tracts into the convent? He had at
that time already written several small books
against the monastic life, and it is likely that
some of these had been clandestinely introduced,
the perusal of which convinced these &ldquo;sisters&rdquo;
that their profession was not sanctioned by the
Scriptures, and that it was dangerous to their
morals. They became so thoroughly assured
of the enormous error they had committed in
thus secluding themselves from the world, and
were so heartily weary of the unnatural restraint
imposed upon them, that they earnestly besought
their relatives to liberate them for their souls&rsquo;
sake! But these appeals were unheard, and
now probably the unhappy petitioners turned
immediately to Luther. He not only favored
their resolution to escape, but selected his
courageous friend, Bernhard Koppe, a citizen
of Torgau, to execute the project. Two other
citizens of the same place accompanied him on
the adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>George Spalatin, Court Chaplain and Secretary
of the Elector, reports that they fled from
the convent on the night before Easter, April
4, 1523. There were nine of them in all.</p>
<p>The accounts of the manner in which their
rescue was effected, differ. Some historians
report that prudence required them to preserve
the strictest secrecy as long as they were
traversing the territory of Duke George, who
was violently opposed to the Reformation, and
hence they were conveyed away in a covered
wagon, and a few affirm, on the authority of
reliable documents, that they were concealed in
casks. The historians, however, agree that
Koppe performed his part in the enterprise with
consummate courage and skill. It is very
likely that the nuns were aware of Koppe&rsquo;s
design, and held themselves in readiness at the
appointed time. Tradition tells us that they
escaped through the window of Catharine&rsquo;s
cell. To this day, they show at Nimtschen a
slipper which they say Catharine lost in the
hurry of the flight.</p>
<p>They arrived at Wittenberg on the 7th of
April, under circumstances calculated to excite
the sympathy of every feeling heart. As they
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
deserted the convent against the will of their
relatives, and most of them probably being
orphans, they did not know where to find shelter
or support. But Luther, who had advised their
flight, and aided in effecting it, kindly received
them, and spared no pains to render their condition
comfortable. In a few but expressive
words to Spalatin, he announced their arrival
and depicted their destitution. He thus writes
on the 10th of April: &ldquo;These eloped nuns have
come to me; they are in destitute circumstances,
but as very respectable citizens of Torgau have
brought them, there can be no suspicion entertained
as to their moral character. I sincerely
pity their forlorn state, and particularly that
of the great number still confined in convents,
who are going to ruin in that condition of constrained
and unnatural celibacy. <span class="gs">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</span> How
tyrannical and cruel,&rdquo; continues Luther, &ldquo;many
parents and relatives of these oppressed women
in Germany are! But ye popes and bishops! who
can censure you with sufficient severity? who
can sufficiently abominate your wickedness and
blindness for upholding these accursed institutions?
But this is not the place to speak at
large on this subject. You ask, dear Spalatin,
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
what I intend to do with these nuns? I shall
report these facts to their relatives, so that they
may provide for them. If they should refuse,
I shall look to some other persons, for several
have promised aid. Their names are Margaretta
Staupitz, Elizabeth de Carnitz, Eva Grossin,
Eva Sch&ouml;nfield and her Sister Margaret,
Lunette de Golis, Margaret de Zeschau and
her sister Catharine, and Catharine de Bora.
They are, indeed, objects worthy of compassion,
and Christ will be served by conferring favors
on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he could not afford to support them himself,
he begged his friend to solicit donations at
court, that these fugitives might be supported
for several weeks. By that time he hoped to
send them to their friends or patrons. As
Spalatin did not reply immediately, Luther
wrote again, and begged not to be forgotten.
He added, &ldquo;Yea, I even exhort the Prince to
send a contribution. I will keep it a profound
secret, and tell no one that he gave anything
to these apostate nuns who have been rescued
from their prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the Elector, who
esteemed Luther highly, sent him the desired
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
relief. The pacific Prince only wished the fact
of his contribution to be kept secret, that he
might not give the Romish clergy, and particularly
Duke George of Saxony, occasion for new
complaint.</p>
<p>Luther&rsquo;s intercessions in behalf of the nuns
with their relatives seem to have been fruitless,
but the people of Wittenberg were liberal
beyond his expectations in their donations for
their support. They were kindly received into
various families, and hospitably entertained.
In this way Philip Reichenbach, a magistrate
of the city, became the protector or foster-father
of Catharine de Bora, who, by her virtuous and
dignified behavior, rendered herself worthy of
his paternal benevolence. This is, of itself, a
sufficient refutation of the slanders of Romish
writers, who charge her with leading a dissolute
life until her marriage with Luther; for no city
official, such as Reichenbach, would have
hazarded his own character by harboring a
licentious woman. Neither would Dr. Glacius
and other eminent divines have sought her
hand in marriage, as they perseveringly did,
nor would she have enjoyed the friendship and
confidence of Amsdorff and other professors of
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
the University if she had not sustained a character
above suspicion. The epitaph on her
tomb-stone at Torgau commemorates her
virtues in most exalted terms of eulogy, from
the time of her escape to her death.</p>
<p>The flight of the nuns was itself an unusual
event, but it became immensely important, for
extraordinary consequences resulted from it.
Pains were taken to conceal the bold step they
had assumed, especially from all other convents.
But these exertions were useless; nuns at other
places heard what their more adventurous
sisters at Nimtschen had dared to do, and they
also undertook to fly from their narrow, unwholesome
cells to breathe the pure air of
heaven. The abbess and four other nuns of
the Benedictine convent at Zeitz; six at Sormitz;
eight at Pentwitz, and sixteen at
Wiedenstadt, escaped in a short time. Luther&rsquo;s
enemies now assailed him with ferocious malignity.
They regarded him as the author of
all this enormous mischief, and tried to show
that his work was productive of nothing but
unmitigated evil, because it occasioned such
abominable results as the flight of poor nuns
from their convent prisons. Luther replied to
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
them very briefly; he represented the dark
side of the picture of conventual life, and narrated
some striking facts in illustration. He
published the life of a nun, <i>Florentine de Oberweimer</i>,
who had escaped from a convent at
Eisleben. &ldquo;I was but six years old,&rdquo; she says,
&ldquo;when I was sent to the convent by my parents.
When I was eleven, without knowing or being
asked whether I could or would observe the
rules, I was compelled to take the vow. When
I was fourteen, and I began to find out that
this mode of life was against my nature, and
hence complained to the abbess, she told me
that I must be contented and should continue
to be a nun no matter what I thought or felt.
I then wrote to the learned Dr. Luther and
begged his advice: but my letter was intercepted
by my superiors, who immediately put
me in prison, where I remained four weeks and
suffered much. The abbess then put me under
the bans. (Florentine then minutely describes
the severe treatment she received before the
ban was dissolved.) After that, I wrote to my
relative, Caspar de Watzdorf, who loved the
gospel truth, and complained of my treatment.
This also became known to the abbess, and I
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
cannot tell to strangers how shamefully I was
abused by her and others. <i>I was so violently
beaten by her and four other persons that they
became completely exhausted.</i> She put me in
prison again and fastened my feet with iron
chains,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p>In the dedication of this little book to the
Duke of Mansfeld, in whose dominions the
convent was located, Luther wrote on the 2nd
of March, 1524, &ldquo;What are you about, ye
princes and lords, that ye drive the people to
God whether they will or not? It is not your
office nor in your power. To outward obedience
you may compel them, but God will regard no
vow that is not cheerfully and voluntarily kept.
Hence, my dear, gracious sirs, I have published
this little narrative that all the world may know
<i>what conventual life is, and the devil&rsquo;s folly
thus be made known</i>. There are princes and
lords who are very indignant about this affair,
and it is no wonder. If they knew what I know,
they would perhaps honor me more for it, and
contribute much more towards spreading it
abroad than I am doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Luther was not the only one who was
charged with being accessory to the flight of
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
these nuns. Leonard Koppe, as the chief
instrument in effecting their escape, was, perhaps,
exposed to greater dangers and persecutions
than Luther, who was powerfully protected
by his prince. For although Koppe had formerly
been a councillor and a government auditor,
yet he had reason to fear the worst treatment
from the clergy if his participation in the act
should become generally known. Hence he
sought to conceal it: but Luther, who was a
stranger to the fear of man, and who, in all
things, went to work openly and boldly, was of
a different opinion. Fully convinced that
Koppe had performed a meritorious act, of
which he should not be ashamed, but rather
boast, he mentioned his name in a letter to
Spalatin a few days after the escape of the
nuns; but he also deemed it prudent to write
to Koppe and inspire him with courage. &ldquo;Be
assured,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;that God has so ordained
it, and that it is not your work or counsel;
never mind the clamor of those who denounce
it as a most wicked undertaking, and who do
not believe it was so ordered of God. Shame!
shame! they will say; the fool, Leonard Koppe,
has suffered himself to be led by that cursed
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
heretical monk, and has aided nine nuns to fly
from the convent at once and to violate their
vows. To this you will reply: &lsquo;<i>This is
indeed a strange way of keeping the thing
secret.</i> You are betraying me, and the whole
convent of Nimtschen will be up against me, or
they will now hear that I have been the robber.&rsquo;
But my reasons for not keeping it secret are
good: 1. That it may be known that I did
not advise it to be concealed; for what we do,
we do in and for God, and do not shun the
light of day. Would to heaven I could in this
or some other way rescue all troubled consciences
and empty all convents! I would not
be afraid to confess my own agency in the
business, nor that of all my assistants. Confidence
in Jesus, whose gospel is destroying the
kingdom of Antichrist, would sustain me, <i>even
if it should cost me my life</i>. 2. I do it for the
sake of the poor nuns, and of their relatives,
so that no one may be able to say they were
involuntarily abducted by wicked fellows, and
thus be robbed of their reputation. 3. To
warn the nobility and pious gentry who have
children in convents to take them away themselves,
so that no worse thing befal them. You
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
know that I <i>advised</i> and <i>sanctioned</i> the enterprise;
that you <i>executed</i> it, and that the nuns
<i>consented</i> and <i>earnestly desired</i> it, and I will
here briefly give the reasons for it before God
and the world. First, <i>The nuns themselves had
before most humbly solicited the help of their
relatives and friends in effecting their release;
they gave them satisfactory reasons why such a
life could no longer be endured, for it interfered
with their souls&rsquo; salvation, and they promised
to be faithful and dutiful children when they
should be released.</i> All this was positively
denied to them, and they were forsaken by all
their relations. Hence they had the right,
yea, were compelled to relieve their burdened
consciences, and save their souls by seeking
help from other quarters, and those who were
in a position to afford counsel and aid, were
bound by Christian love to bestow them.
<i>Secondly</i>, It is not right that young girls should
be locked up in convents where there is no daily
use made of the word of God, and where the
gospel is seldom or never heard, and where, of
course, these girls are exposed to the severest
temptations. <i>Thirdly</i>, It is plain that a person
may be compelled to do before the world what
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
is not cheerfully done; but before God and in
his service no one has a right to use compulsion.
<i>Fourthly</i>, Women were created for other purposes
than to spend a lazy and useless life in a
convent.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p class="h2sum">Luther&rsquo;s Reflections&mdash;Example of the Apostles&mdash;Celibacy&mdash;Gregory
VII.&mdash;Luther&rsquo;s Change of Mind&mdash;Luther&rsquo;s
Marriage&mdash;Character of Catharine.</p>
<p>All these preliminary steps were not unpremeditated
by Luther. Encouraged by the
example of other clergymen who had married,
he now began seriously to reflect on the <i>propriety
of clerical matrimony</i>.</p>
<p>In these reflections he found no difficulty as
regards the secular clergy, that is, those who
officiated as pastors of churches, because he
considered their office as divinely instituted,
and he knew from history that their celibacy
was forced by the popes under the most cruel
oppression. For although Paul advised the
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
Christians of Corinth to remain unmarried
during the season of persecution,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> yet the first
teachers of Christianity, and even Peter and
most of the other apostles, were married men.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
Besides, celibacy is no where regarded as a
meritorious condition in the New Testament.
Christ himself distinctly commends matrimonial
affection and harmony, and Paul teaches that
it is better to lead a married, than an unchaste
life.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> 1 Cor. 7; 2, 9, 28.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all this, even during the
first three centuries, a peculiar merit began to
be attached to celibacy. Many bishops, who
were, it is true, poorly enough supported,
abstained from matrimony, or, if they were
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
married, separated from their wives. A second
marriage was particularly disapproved. But
as yet there was no law on the subject, and the
celibacy of the bishops was far from being
general. Many of them were married men.
It was only in the fourth century that it became
a general custom for the bishops to lead single
lives, and several councils held during this
period, in this respect severely oppressed the
secular clergy. At the council of Nice, held in
the year 325, the first serious attempt was made
to introduce celibacy, but the attempt failed
through the influence of Bishop Paphnutius, of
Upper Thebes. From this time, most of the
bishops tried their utmost to prevent their
secular clergy from marrying. Some Popes,
since the end of the fourth century, such as
Siricius, Innocent I., Gregory II., Nicolas I.,
and Leo IX. also made attempts to restrain the
priests. The predictions of Paul in 1 Tim. 4;
1, 3, were soon fulfilled. Scarcely had Gregory
VII. arrived at the papal dignity than he
exerted all his influence to render the secular
clergy independent of the state, and this he
thought could be best accomplished through
celibacy. The orders which he communicated
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
to the council held at Rome in 1074 in relation
to this subject were very severe; the married
clergy were to be separated from their wives
or be deposed, and from that time forth no man
was to be ordained to the clerical office who
would not bind himself to remain unmarried all
his life. The opposition to this severe regulation
was strong. In Germany they even committed
violence on the papal ambassador, and
openly reproached the Pope as a heretic, who
disregarded the plain instructions of the Scriptures
and introduced regulations which militated
against human nature and Divine Providence,
and which would lead to the most scandalous
improprieties. When Archbishop Siegfried of
Mainz held a council at Erfurt, and communicated
the commands of the Pope to the secular
clergy, the excitement was so great that he was
in danger of his life. The Archbishop of
Passau did not fare better. At the council of
Worms, in 1076, Germans and French violently
opposed the Pope, and proclaimed him as a
usurper of the papal sovereignty. At a meeting
in Pavia, the Italian bishops even <i>put this
Pope under the ban</i>.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all this opposition, Gregory
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
could not be turned from his purpose. He
executed his orders with all possible severity,
and even demanded of the princes to forbid
those priests who would not obey him from
administering the sacraments or reading mass.
Thus his unnatural law triumphed in 1080,
though not universally, for Urban II. felt himself
compelled in 1089 and 1095 to re-enact it,
and it was reserved for Innocent III. in 1215
more firmly to establish celibacy as a disciplinary
law, although, long before this, marriage
had been declared to be a <i>sacrament</i>. In his
address in 1520 to his Imperial Majesty and
German nobility, Luther strenuously advocated
the marriage of the <i>secular</i> clergy.</p>
<p>He entertained different views, however, with
regard to the <i>monastic</i> order, and he made
their celibacy a subject of investigation at
Wartburg castle. Although, thought he, their
office is not of divine appointment, yet they had
chosen it, and had consecrated themselves to
God; in most instances they had voluntarily
assumed the vow, and hence were bound to
keep it. Melanchthon, who had married a
short time before, and Carlstadt, who followed
his example a short time after, to Luther&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
great joy, had both advocated the marriage of
the monastic clergy in their writings, although
not altogether with his approbation.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> &ldquo;Our
Wittenbergers even wish the monks to have
wives!&rdquo; thus he wrote to Spalatin, August 6th,
1521, &ldquo;<i>but they shall force no wife on me!</i>
I wish Carlstadt&rsquo;s book had more light and
distinctness, for it contains much talent and
learning.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>But Luther&rsquo;s penetrating mind soon discovered
the truth. He communicated his new-formed
opinion to his father, and openly came
out in favor of the marriage of the monks.
Although he now sturdily maintained this side
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
of the question, yet he did not at this time feel
himself inclined to matrimony. This was in
the autumn of 1522.</p>
<p>Two years after this (1524), when he heard
of a report in circulation that he was to be
married, he thus wrote to Spalatin: &ldquo;From
the opinion which I have hitherto had, and now
have, it is probable I shall never marry; not
that I do not feel myself to be flesh and blood,
for I am neither wood nor stone, but I feel no
inclination in that way.&rdquo; Still, he highly
honored the married relation as an institution
of God. Long after this he wrote thus to his
friend Stiefel: &ldquo;I did not marry as though I
expected to live long, but to establish my doctrine
by my example, and to leave behind me a
consolation for weak consciences.&rdquo; &ldquo;I married
also for the purpose of opposing the doctrine
of Satan, and putting to shame the scandalous
immorality practised in the papacy, and if I
had no wife I would now marry even in my old
age, just to honor the divine institution and
to pour contempt on the ungodly lives of so
many popish priests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luther&rsquo;s mind gradually underwent a change.
He now secretly resolved to marry Catharine,
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
who had already, as we shall see below, expressed
a tender feeling towards him. An
intimation of his purpose we have in a letter to
his relative, Dr. John Ruhl, of May 4, 1525:
&ldquo;If I can manage to spite the devil, I will
marry Catharine before I die if I hear that my
enemies continue their reproaches.&rdquo; From this
it is evident that he would not have married, at
least at this time, if the clamor of his enemies,
the fear and weakness of his friends, and
various other circumstances, had not determined
him to take the step. The generous and public
declaration of John the Constant<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> in favor of
the Reformation, as well as his own opposition
to the celibacy of the clergy, and the desire of
gratifying the long-expressed wish of his father,
hastened the consummation of his design.
&ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I could no longer deny this
last act of obedience to my dear father, who
earnestly entreated me to marry.&rdquo; Besides
this, he wished to set an example to others
around him, for many whom he advised to
marry had reproached him for writing against
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
monastic celibacy and yet not practising his
own doctrine.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he wrote frequently to his
friends on this subject, and what gratified him
much in the prospect of his marriage was the
chagrin it would occasion the Romish party,
and subsequent experience proved that he was
not disappointed in his hopes.</p>
<p>Anxious as he was to consummate the event,
yet his choice of Catharine was not precipitate.
It was only after he was assured of the superlative
excellence of her character that he offered
her his hand. She conducted herself in her
lowly circumstances with such a reserved and
womanly dignity that he thought her to be
somewhat prudish and proud, and it was only
after a more intimate acquaintance that he
perceived her numerous good qualities. &ldquo;If I
had felt a disposition to marry thirteen years
ago,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I would have preferred Eva
Sch&ouml;nfield, who is now the wife of Dr. Basilius.
I did not love my Catharine at that time, for I
suspected her of being proud. But it has
pleased God otherwise, and, blessed be His
name, all things have turned out well, for I
have a pious, faithful wife, as Solomon says,
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
Prov. 31; 11, my heart doth safely trust in
her, and she contributes so much to my content
and manages my affairs so prudently, <i>that I have
no need of spoil</i>, that is, I have no temptation
to envy the wealth of others or to prey upon
my neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was she, on her part, in a hurry about
giving her consent, but she deliberated long.
Though she was poor, yet she followed the
inclination of her heart.</p>
<p>Before he thought of marrying her himself
he recommended her to Jerome S. Baumgartner,
a Nurnberg Patrician, and a student of theology,
who had a very tender regard for Catharine,
and to whom she was not altogether indifferent.
Luther wrote to him (Oct. 12, 1524,): &ldquo;If you
have made up your mind to marry Catharine,
you had better be in a hurry before another
takes her who is near at hand. She has not
ceased to love you, and I should be much
gratified to see you marry her.&rdquo; But his recommendation
was of no avail, probably because
Baumgartner, after his return home, was captivated
by some other lady. The other suitor to
whom Luther alludes was Dr. Caspar Glacius,
vicar of the Archdeaconate of the Castle Church
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
at Wittenberg. Luther favored his pretensions
to her hand, and this led her to complain to
Amsdorff, Luther&rsquo;s friend. She requested him
to induce Luther to cease his importunity in
behalf of Glacius, for whom she had no inclination
whatever. She, however, honestly
acknowledged to Amsdorff she would not refuse
an offer either from himself or Luther. She
was not mistaken in her estimate of Glacius,
for he was an ill-tempered man, who never was
at peace with his congregation, and was dismissed
from his office in 1537.</p>
<p>The marriage of a nun was, until that time,
unheard of, and hence we need not wonder
that Luther&rsquo;s enemies took every opportunity
to calumniate him as well as his intended wife.
As Erasmus says, &ldquo;It was at that time an
almost universal sentiment that the Antichrist
would be the son of a monk and a nun;&rdquo; and
he remarks in relation to this old saying, &ldquo;If
this were true, the world has had thousands of
Antichrists!&rdquo; His enemies knew too well how
to make the most of this popular belief, but
they went still further, and charged him with
all the misfortunes that befel the country; the
demolition of the convents in the Peasants&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
War, and other similar calamities, for they said
that he inflamed the hatred of the peasants
against monastic life and the possessions of the
clergy, &ldquo;And all this he did,&rdquo; they affirmed,
&ldquo;that he might marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But many of his friends also disapproved of
such an alliance. &ldquo;Our wise men are fiercely
excited on the subject,&rdquo; wrote Luther, after
his marriage, to Stiefel. &ldquo;They must confess
it is the work of God, but my professional
character, as well as that of the lady, blinds
them and makes them think and speak unkindly.
But the Lord lives, who is greater in us than
he who is in the world, and there are more on
my side than on theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was perfectly in character with Luther
not to delay the execution of a purpose he had
once formed. He was particularly opposed to
long-standing matrimonial engagements, and
hence says, &ldquo;I advise a speedy marriage after
a positive engagement; it is dangerous to postpone
the consummation, for Satan is ready to
oppose many obstacles, by means of slanderers,
and sometimes the friends of both parties interfere.
Hence do not postpone the affair. If I
had not married secretly, and with the knowledge
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
of but few friends, my marriage would
have been prevented, for my best friends exclaimed,
&lsquo;Do not take this one, but another.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Hence we are not surprised to learn that his
final engagement to Catharine and his marriage
occurred on the same day.</p>
<p>His friends did not maintain that he should
not marry at all, but they did not esteem it
wise that one who had been a monk should
marry a lady who had been a nun. They
feared that the step would retard the Reformation
among the common people, who did not
look with indifference on the violation of the
vow of chastity.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> But Luther thought otherwise,
and believed that by marrying a nun he
would inflict a terrible blow on the whole
system of monasticism.</p>
<p>The most minute attention was at that time
paid to Luther&rsquo;s doctrine and conduct, and the
most unimportant circumstances in his eventful
life were reported with the greatest care. We
should hence suppose that the precise date of
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
his marriage would also be noted, and yet the
reports are very different. Melanchthon&rsquo;s
statement is the most reliable, for he lived at
that time in Wittenberg; he had daily intercourse
with Luther, and hence may be supposed
to be intimately acquainted with his domestic
circumstances. In a letter to Camerarius (July
21, 1525,) he gives the true date of Luther&rsquo;s
marriage: &ldquo;As it may happen,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;that no one will give you a correct account
of Luther&rsquo;s marriage, I have thought it proper
to inform you of the facts. On the 13th of
June, 1525, he, quite unexpectedly, married
Catharine De Bora.&rdquo; There is no good reason
to doubt Melanchthon&rsquo;s report of the date, which
is established by many other witnesses, and
hence it is unnecessary to refute those who give
other dates.</p>
<p>Agreeably to these accounts, compared with
others, it appears that Luther on the Tuesday
after Trinity, June 13, 1525, in order to avoid
all excitement, took with him John Bugenhagen
(Pomeranius) pastor of the City Church, Dr.
John Apel, Professor of Canonical Law, and
Louis Cranach, Court Painter, Councillor, and
Chamberlain, without the knowledge of his other
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
friends, and proceeded to the house of the town-clerk,
Reichenbach, with whom Catharine lived,
and there, in the presence of these three friends,
he asked her consent in marriage. Unexpected
as this declaration was, yet she yielded to the
solicitation of her former deliverer and benefactor.
Soon after, the Provost, Dr. Justus
Jonas, and the wife of Cranach, entered, and
Luther was there married in the presence of
these four witnesses, Bugenhagen performing
the ceremony. Luther was forty-two years of
age, and Catharine twenty-seven. He did not
even ask the consent of the Elector; but, as we
shall subsequently see, he sent him an humble
request for some game to supply his wedding
dinner-table.</p>
<p>Before the wedding, Luther offered the following
prayer: &ldquo;Heavenly Father, inasmuch
as thou hast honored me with the office of the
ministry, and wilt also that I should be honored
as a husband and the head of a family, grant
me grace to govern my household in a godly
and Christian manner. Grant me wisdom and
strength to direct and train all the members of
my family in the right way. Give them willing
hearts and pious dispositions to be obedient, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
to follow in all things the instructions of thy
word. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The golden wedding-rings of Luther and his
wife were probably not exchanged on this
evening, but afterwards. The celebrated artist,
Albert D&uuml;rer, of Nurnberg, made them at the
order and expense of the Patrician and Councillor
von Pirckenheim. They are minutely
described by some writers, and exact representations
of them are given in various curious
works. One of these rings has exchanged
hands many times by gift, sale, and inheritance.
Numerous imitations of them have been made,
and sold to collectors of such articles.</p>
<p>When, on the following day, the marriage of
Luther became generally known, the town
council of Wittenberg sent him various articles,
such as are usually considered essential to
wedding festivals of every age and country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p class="h2sum">Wedding-Dinner&mdash;Melanchthon&mdash;Slanders.</p>
<p>Thus had Luther, actuated by the purest
motives, suddenly and silently, entered into this
matrimonial alliance. Now it was no longer
secret, and in compliance with a custom common
in that day he determined to invite a
number of his friends, in and out of Wittenberg,
including his parents, to a wedding-dinner.
This was to occur on the 27th of June, two
weeks after his marriage. On that day also,
he purposed to conduct his wife publicly to his
own residence at the Augustinian monastery.
To his absent friends he sent written invitations,
seven of which are still extant. But he was
particularly desirous of having his parents, who
resided at Mansfeld, present on the occasion.
He was anxious to show them that he had
finally gratified their most ardent wishes in
abandoning the monastic life and entering on
matrimony. But he also wished to make them
personally acquainted with Catharine, and to
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
receive from them their parental blessing.
They, with three or four others of his friends,
accepted the invitation. At this, as well at
the other more private festival on the day after
his marriage, the town council of Wittenberg
expressed their highest respect for Luther by
sending him some essential contributions to his
dinner.</p>
<p>It may appear remarkable, at first sight, that
Melanchthon, Luther&rsquo;s most intimate friend
and inseparable companion, should not have
been present at this nor at the previous solemnity,
nor even consulted by Luther on the
subject of his marriage. But he well knew the
timidity and excessive sensitiveness of Melanchthon.
He knew that his friend was so painfully
concerned for his reputation and peace of mind,
that though he could not disapprove of the act,
yet he would reprove him for the manner and
time, fearing the evil consequences that might
result to the work of the Reformation. Hence
Luther did not consult Melanchthon, and even
avoided his company at this time. The whole
circumstance occasioned much painful anxiety
to Melanchthon, not because he did not sanction
the act in itself, but because it would give
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
the numerous enemies of Luther fresh occasion
for more bitter persecution and more virulent
calumny.</p>
<p>Although Luther had acted with great deliberation
in this affair, making it a subject of
most fervent prayer, and hastening its consummation
in order only to avoid excitement, yet
occasionally he sometimes seemed deeply depressed
on that very account, because in the
opinion of many, the whole transaction was
calculated to injure his reputation. But through
the fraternal consolations of Melanchthon, he
was soon restored to his usual vivacity. He
felt himself happy in the possession of Catharine;
for his marriage, instead of interfering
with his numerous professional engagements,
only inspired him with renewed courage and
strength in the prosecution of his work. In
many of his letters written at this period, he
expresses the most affectionate interest in his
wife and the most perfect satisfaction with his
connubial state.</p>
<p>It would, however, have been surprising if
the enemies of Luther had passed in silence his
marriage with a former nun. The most outrageous
slanders and abominable falsehoods
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
might have been anticipated. Their hatred of
the man who had shaken the pillars of their
spiritual despotism, was also to be vented
against the woman whom he had chosen for his
wife. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; cried out these despicable slanderers,
&ldquo;see the real design of his apostasy
from the Catholic Church! It was only that
he might marry.&rdquo; And yet Luther was not married
until eight years after he had taken the
first step towards the Reformation. They
loaded Catharine with the most opprobrious and
disgraceful epithets, and endeavored to cover
her husband with shame and contempt. But
they did not reflect that if Luther had been
inclined to an irregular course of life, he might
more easily, with much less excitement and
much less censure too, have indulged his evil
propensities as an unmarried monk than as a
married clergyman. Even King Henry VIII.
and Duke George of Saxony sent him letters
most bitterly censuring his course. The language
of the royal slanderer of England is
especially vulgar, and his accusations are infamous.
But his more recent enemies have
not been less virulent. Luther, in dealing such
a terrible blow on their forefathers, has fearfully
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
wounded them also, and that wound will
never heal. They most dishonestly perverted
his language, and endeavored to dishonor the
name of Catharine by the most wretchedly contrived
and disgraceful fables. The principal
object of Luther&rsquo;s enemies was to sever the
matrimonial bond which united him and his
wife. They exerted all their diabolical cunning
to gain Catharine over by their machinations,
and induce her to separate herself from Luther
in order to return to the convent. Two young
men, members of the University of Leipzig,
were employed to write <i>Eulogies on Monastic
Life</i>, and send them to Luther in the hope that
they would fall into Catharine&rsquo;s hands, and
induce her, as a penitent sinner, to resume the
veil. But neither he nor his wife honored these
writings with much attention at that time.
They were sent back to their authors in not
quite as good a condition as when received, for
the servants, without Luther&rsquo;s knowledge, had
taken special pains to deface them. They
accompanied the papers with the Latin word
<i>asini</i> (asses), so ingeniously arranged in a
square, that beginning in the centre the same
word could be read in forty different directions.
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Some time after, Luther answered these
writings and constructed several amusing fables
on them. The treatment of these eulogies by
Luther and his wife, and especially by the servants,
created such an excitement in Leipzig
that Jerome Walther, a councillor, found it
necessary to communicate a full report of the
whole transaction to the Court Chancellor of
Duke George. The infamous attempt, however,
to separate Luther and his wife signally failed.</p>
<p>The great restorer of the true gospel doctrine
might have lived in open profligacy as a monk,
and it would not probably have been noticed;
but to marry was an unpardonable sin. The
acknowledged teachers of the priests have laid
down such doctrine as the following: Cardinal
de Campeggi has taught that &ldquo;It is a greater
sin for a priest to marry than to lead an infamous
life.&rdquo; The Jesuit Coster taught that
&ldquo;Although a priest who indulges the most
unnatural appetite commits a great evil, yet he
sins still more if he marries;&rdquo; and Cornelius &agrave;
Lapide remarks, &ldquo;For those who have taken
the vow of chastity, it is better that they live
unchastely than marry.&rdquo; The men who taught
such morals were the opponents of Luther&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
marriage. The most influential of his enemies
at this time was Erasmus, who, in the beginning
did not disallow Luther&rsquo;s merits, but he was
fond of ridicule and sarcasm. He slandered
Catharine most infamously, but eight months
afterwards he had the magnanimity to retract
his false accusations.</p>
<p>As we have already learned, Luther had
determined to give a particular wedding-festival
especially for the sake of his own parents, but
we have no account of his having invited the
parents of his wife. Every unprejudiced reader
will conclude that either her parents were dissatisfied
with her flight and marriage, or, what
is more probable, they were no longer living.
For from the well-known letter of Luther to
Koppe, we cannot even with certainty conclude
that her parents were living at the time of her
escape from the convent. He states that those
nine nuns had most earnestly implored their
parents and <i>relatives</i> to deliver them from the
prison, from which we presume that some of
them were orphans, and for this reason applied
to their relations. But Luther&rsquo;s enemies still
maintained that the parents of his wife were
living, but were of no account, and hence not
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
mentioned at all. It is likely that <i>poverty</i> first
moved them to place their daughter in a convent
early in life. Luther and some of his cotemporaries
bear testimony to the fact that she possessed
no property. At one place he thus
expresses himself relative to the condition of
her property, &ldquo;As thou gavest her to me, so I
return her to thee again, O thou faithful God,
who richly aboundest in all things; support,
sustain, and teach her as thou hast supported,
sustained, and taught me, thou Father of the
orphan and judge of the widow.&rdquo; Even if she
had taken property with her into the convent,
how could she have secured it in her flight?
But when Erasmus writes and says, &ldquo;Luther
has married a wife, a most beautiful daughter
of the celebrated family of Bora, but, as is said,
without a fortune,&rdquo; this might also proceed
from the dissatisfaction of her relatives with
her marriage and her flight from the convent.</p>
<p>But though those enemies of Luther could
not exactly show the humble condition of his
wife&rsquo;s parents, others tried hard to throw doubt,
at least, on her <i>noble</i> birth. They could not
deny that her mother was entitled to that distinction
of rank, but they totally reject her
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
father&rsquo;s claim to it, and because Luther does
not mention him in his writings, they draw the
unsound conclusion that he must have belonged
to the very lowest class of society. Catharine&rsquo;s
honor would not in the least have been periled
even if her father had been of humble birth.
But the most unimportant circumstances were
industriously used by Luther&rsquo;s enemies to degrade
him; hence, they would not allow her distinguished
birth, although the plainest proofs of
the fact were given. His opponents sometimes
contradicted each other. They all agreed in
most scandalously calumniating him, but in
their accusations they sometimes singularly
differed, and often unintentionally wrote something
which was more honorable to Luther than
injurious. Cochlaeus, for example, charges it
as the greatest sin of Luther &ldquo;that he rescued
from the convent nine nuns, <i>who were all</i> of
<i>noble rank</i>, and, to the eternal disgrace of so
many distinguished families, led them away.&rdquo;
Could this deadly enemy of Luther only have
conjectured that some of his brethren of the
faith ever intended to assail Catharine&rsquo;s birth,
he would have been more careful than to have
spoken of <i>noble</i> rank and <i>distinguished</i> families.
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
But the testimony of one such cotemporary is
proof sufficient of her noble origin, and we need
not stop to refute those who maintain that there
never even existed a <i>family</i> of <i>de Bora</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p class="h2sum">Luther&rsquo;s Domestic Life&mdash;Character of Catharine&mdash;Perils
of Luther&mdash;Sickness&mdash;Death of his Parents&mdash;Private
Life&mdash;Catharine.</p>
<p>Luther led with Catharine a very peaceful
and happy domestic life. It would be doing
him great injustice and placing him in the rank
of common men, to judge of his conjugal and
domestic demeanor from his public character.
Here there was no trace of that severity and
violence which can only find an apology in the
frequent insulting conduct of his enemies, the
unrefined spirit of the times, but, above all, in
his burning zeal for the glory of God and the
truth of the Gospel. No! in the circle of his
family he was an affectionate husband and
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
tender father; kind and condescending to all
his household, and benevolent to the poor. In
writing to Stiefel (Aug. 11, 1526), he playfully
says: &ldquo;My rib, Kate, salutes you. She
is well, with God&rsquo;s help; she is amiable,
obedient, and obliging in all things to a greater
degree than I could have hoped for, thank
heaven, so that I would not exchange my
poverty for the wealth of Cr&oelig;sus.&rdquo; When he
had finished his commentary on the Epistle to
the Galatians, he cried out, &ldquo;This is my letter
to which I am betrothed; it is my Katy von
Bora!&rdquo; On the 31st of August, 1538, he thus
writes to Bernard von Dohlen: &ldquo;If I were a
young man again, now since I have experienced
the wickedness of the world, if a queen were
offered to me after my Catharine, I would
rather die than marry a second time.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
could not have a more <i>obedient</i> wife unless I
would have one hewn out of stone.&rdquo; Many
such expressions occur in his table-talk. Among
other things, he says, &ldquo;I hear that there are
much greater faults and occasions of disagreement
among married people than I find in my
wife. This is an abundant reason that I should
love and esteem her, because she is <i>sincere</i> and
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
<i>upright</i>, as a <i>pious</i> and <i>discreet</i> wife should be.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have a <i>pious</i> and <i>faithful</i> wife in whom the
heart of her husband doth safely trust.&rdquo; Prov.
31; 11. &ldquo;I value her more highly than I
would the whole kingdom of France and the
sovereignty of Venice; for God has given me
a <i>pious</i> wife.&rdquo; &ldquo;The best and most valuable
gift of God is a pious, affectionate, godly,
domestic wife, with whom you can live at peace,
to whom you may entrust all that you possess;
yea, your very body and life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Catharine had in Luther not only an
affectionate husband, but a man who, on account
of his enlightened understanding, his widespread
usefulness, and his undaunted heroism,
deserved all the veneration he received from
all the truly pious of his generation.</p>
<p>From this time forth, Catharine was totally
and forever weaned from the monastic life, and
all the anxieties for the future which may have
distressed her on her first escape, had now
vanished. Though Luther&rsquo;s worldly circumstances
were not the most flourishing, yet he
was aided by the liberality of the princes and
other noble-minded men to such an extent, at
least, that he did not absolutely suffer for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
necessaries of life.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> In this respect, Catharine&rsquo;s
circumstances were much improved. However,
many dangers threatened the bold champion of
truth, right, and liberty, which were calculated
to disturb the happy serenity of his wife. He
had several alarming attacks of sickness, which
occasioned her painful solicitude. In the first
year of his marriage some noblemen conspired
against him because he effected the escape of
thirteen nuns out of a cloister in the territory
of Duke George. He himself acknowledges
this in a letter to Stiefel, and says of it, &ldquo;I
have chased away Satan from this booty of
Christ.&rdquo; Hence, with tears, she entreated him
not to leave Wittenberg at such a perilous time
when he was invited to the wedding of Spalatin,
and he yielded. But he was not accustomed to
be alarmed at the thunder-clouds which rolled
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
over him. Even as early as 1526, he undertook
a journey in company with Catharine, and
yet that was the time he had most to fear. But
he was never free from danger. In 1530, when
his father was lying on his death-bed, he dared
not venture to visit him, but wrote an affecting
letter, stating that his friends positively forbade
his leaving Wittenberg, lest he might be murdered.
A Jewish physician of Posen was hired
for two thousand golden guilders to poison him.
In 1541 he was waylaid by an assassin, but
escaped. Notwithstanding his vigorous constitution,
which seemed to promise extreme old
age, yet from early youth he was subject to
frequent severe attacks of sickness, and under
such circumstances we may well wonder, that
besides his numerous professional labors, he
was able to prepare so many theological works,
to conduct so extensive a correspondence with
men of every class of society, and accomplish
so many journeys, which must have consumed
much time.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> His master-piece, The Translation
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
of the Bible, was a work which scarcely any
learned man of the present day could have
accomplished in the same space of time, under
similar circumstances. Let it be remembered
that the first time he ever saw the whole of the
Bible in the Latin language he was already
twenty-two years of age; that he had few of
the preliminary aids essential to such a work,
and that the German language was at that time
still very imperfect. In twenty-eight years the
translation of the whole Bible was finished and
printed.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>
He suffered most from h&aelig;morrhoidal
affections, the treatment of which was little
understood at that time. These attacks appeared
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
mysterious to him, and in his depression
of mind occasioned by them, and in the indulgence
of a lively imagination, he ascribed the
painful anxieties which he felt, agreeably to
the notions of that day, to the temptations of
the devil, who tried to hinder him in prosecuting
his good work by assuming various forms and
appearances. Attacks of sickness, which were
in part the result of his severe fastings during
his monastic life, were aggravated by his extraordinary
mental labors, by his sedentary habits,
and the numerous painful mortifications of
spirit to which his unconquerable love of the
truth exposed him. Above all, it was the
unhappy sacramentarian controversy in 1525
which had the most injurious influence on his
health. Hence these corporeal sufferings could
never be entirely removed. Yet amid all his
painful and melancholy hours Catharine was to
him a ministering angel. By her affectionate
sympathy, her tender nursing, and prudent
accommodation to his whims, she greatly
relieved his bodily and mental sufferings. She
had frequent occasion to display these amiable
qualities, for her husband had often recurring
attacks of sickness. To notice but a few instances,
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
we will state that as early as 1526 he
suffered with h&aelig;morrhoids, accompanied with
severe oppression of the breast. But it was
particularly in 1527 that he was attacked in a
manner that brought him to the very borders
of the grave. In July, he was so suddenly and
dangerously seized that his wife and friends
trembled for his life. But both of them displayed
a greatness of soul and dignity of
deportment which were truly admirable. Christian
fortitude, perfect resignation to the will of
God, and unshaken confidence in an all-controlling
Providence, animated them both in the
highest degree. They endured their present trials
with pious submission, and with comfortable security
they anticipated future dangers. Luther
did not think that he would recover, but believed
that he should have to part with the wife whose
husband he had been but two years. Catharine
was full of terrible apprehension of being left a
poor widow and mother of one child, without
being able to count much on human aid, and
having no means of support. He was to leave
the sacred work which he had begun, and for
which he would have sacrificed his all, and she
was to be dependent on the kindness of some
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
real and many equivocal friends. Yet Luther
prayed with a submissive heart, and commended
his wife to God&rsquo;s paternal care. &ldquo;My loving
and most benevolent Father! I thank thee
from my heart that it was thy will I should be
poor on the earth, and hence I can leave neither
house, field, money, nor any other property, to
my wife and son. As thou hast given her to
me, so I restore her to thee,&rdquo; &amp;c. He also
consoled his wife with these words; &ldquo;My
beloved Kate, I beseech you to submit to God&rsquo;s
gracious will, if it should please him to take
me to Himself this time. You are my faithful
wife, let the blind, ungodly world say what it
may. Let your conduct be governed by the
word of God, and hold fast to it, and thus you
will have certain and constant comfort against
all the temptations and blasphemies of Satan.&rdquo;
When, at his request, they brought his infant
son to him, he said, &ldquo;O you good, poor little
child! now I commend your beloved mother
and you, poor orphan, to my good and faithful
God. <i>You have nothing</i>; but God, who is the
father of the orphan and the judge of the
widow, will richly provide for you.&rdquo; Here he
again turned to his wife, and said, &ldquo;You know
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
that, excepting the silver cups, we have
nothing.&rdquo; These, and similar expressions,
awakened the most painful emotions in the
heart of Catharine, and yet she tried to conceal
her grief, and to encourage him, &ldquo;My dear
Doctor,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if it is God&rsquo;s will, I would
rather you should be with Him than with me.
But it is not only I and my child who must be
taken into account, and for whom your life
would be valuable, but there are many pious
and Christian souls who have need of your
presence and services. Do not distress yourself
about me; I commend you to His divine
will. I trust he will graciously preserve you.&rdquo;
Eight days after, Luther recovered, to the
great joy of his wife and all his friends.</p>
<p>Not long after, in the same year, a contagious
disease broke out in Wittenberg, which
created so much alarm that the students precipitately
fled, and the University was transferred
to Jena. The Elector, John the Constant,
advised Luther to repair to Jena also;
but this main pillar of the new-born church
would not leave Wittenberg, although there
were cases of the contagion in his own family.
Bugenhagen also remained at the post of duty.
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
Nov. 1, Luther wrote to Amsdorff, &ldquo;My house
is an hospital. I begin to feel anxious about
my wife, who is in a delicate condition. My
infant son has been sick these three days; he
eats nothing and is extremely unwell.&rdquo; But
these attacks were not contagious, and their
alarm soon subsided. In the following year,
Luther suffered from a pulmonary affection and
constant headache. In 1532, he was so severely
attacked with vertigo that apoplexy was
apprehended. He also occasionally suffered
from obstinate boils; in his later years, symptoms
of calculus were also apparent. In 1536,
an affection of the hip-joint confined him to
bed a fortnight. But in 1537, Catharine had
especial occasion to display her affectionate
solicitude, for her husband was again brought
to the very brink of the grave. During this
year he was commanded by John Frederick,
Elector of Saxony, to proceed to Smalcald on
important church business. Although he suffered
severely from calculus, and the weather
was extremely cold, he set out on his journey
on Feb. 1. But he had scarcely arrived at
Smalcald, when the pains increased to such an
extent, to which an obstinate ischury was super-added,
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
that everybody was doubtful of his
recovery. The Elector, who was present, contributed
everything in his power to his restoration.
He visited and consoled him. On his
departure, he thus addressed him: &ldquo;If it should
please God to take you away, be not concerned
about your wife and children. I will take them
into my protection.&rdquo; He recovered sufficiently
to enter on his journey home on the 26th.
Dangerous as travelling appeared to be under
the circumstances, yet it was of immediate
service. On the way, he was relieved of the
principal cause of his intense suffering, and
communicated the joyful event to his wife and
the sympathizing Melanchthon. To the former
he wrote, &ldquo;Yesterday I left Smalcald. I was
not well three days whilst there; in a word, I
was dead, and I had commended you and the
children to God and my gracious Elector, for I
never expected to see you again; but God had
mercy on me. Most fervent prayers to God
were offered for me, and many tears were shed
on my account. God heard these prayers, and
last night I was relieved. I now feel like a
new-born man. Thank God for this; and let
the dear children, with Aunt Magdalena, thank
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
the Heavenly Father, for you had almost lost
me, the earthly father. God performed wonders
towards me last night through the intercession
of pious persons. This I also ascribe
to you, for I presume the Elector ordered word
to be sent to you that I was dying, so that you
might come and speak to me, or at least see
me before I died. That is not necessary now,
you may remain at home, for God has so mercifully
helped me that I expect soon to meet
you happily in our own house. To-day we are
stopping at Gotha.&rdquo; Something similar to this
he wrote to Melanchthon: but, unfortunately,
he had a relapse at Gotha, and anticipated
death so certainly, that he requested Bugenhagen
to administer to him the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.
As soon as Catharine heard of this she could
be no longer restrained from setting out to
meet him. She remained with him all the time,
and accompanied him home. Thus Luther, for
the present, had escaped all apparent dangers,
but every year, for the ensuing nine, he was
attacked by some disease. Dysentery, Rheumatism,
fever, violent vertigo, and headache,
painful cutaneous eruptions, and pulmonary
affections, embittered all his days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The affectionate sympathy, faithful watching,
and tender nursing which he received from his
wife, not only on these occasions, but always
when bowed down under the immense weight of
his other cares, moved him deeply. He frequently
alluded to it in the most touching
language. On his sick bed at Gotha, on Feb.
28, 1537, he commended Catharine, who had
enlivened twelve years of his life, to Bugenhagen,
and bore this favorable testimony to her
character: &ldquo;She has served me not only as a
wife, but with all the fidelity and industry of a
servant.&rdquo; Afterwards, he said, &ldquo;I inconsiderately
look to Catharine and Melanchthon for
greater benefits than to Christ, and yet I know
that neither they nor any human being on
earth can or will ever suffer for me as he has
done.&rdquo; Soon after, he said, &ldquo;How intensely I
longed after my family when I was lying at
Smalcald, almost dead! I thought I should
never see them again. How painful the idea
of separation was! I now believe that this
natural inclination and love which a man has
for his wife, and children for their parents, are
most intense in dying persons.&rdquo; In his last
will, (Jan. 6, 1542,) he said of her &ldquo;that she
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
had always been a pious and faithful wife, and
she always conducted herself handsomely and
worthily, as became a pious and faithful
spouse.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
<p>But Catharine&rsquo;s love for her husband was
extended also to his parents. The most striking
proof of this she gave, when, in Feb., 1530,
Luther&rsquo;s father was lying very sick. She most
heartily wished that he might be conveyed to
Wittenberg, where she could nurse him. &ldquo;Dear
Father,&rdquo; wrote Luther to him, &ldquo;my brother
Jacob has informed me that you are dangerously
sick. I wished most eagerly to go and
see you, but my friends dissuaded me from my
purpose, fearing the danger to which I would
expose myself, for you know that the Peasants
are so violently opposed to me.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> But it would
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
rejoice me greatly if it were possible for you
and mother to come to us. My wife also, with
tears, expresses her desire that you should
come. We will here nurse you most tenderly.&rdquo;
But the father was unable to go, and died in a
few months after, whilst Luther was residing at
Coburg, where he had concealed himself during
the diet of Augsburg. As soon as Catharine
heard of the event, she was very solicitous about
the effect of the intelligence on her absent
husband, of whose affectionate attachment to
his father she was well aware. She wrote to
him a letter full of consolation, and in order
more effectually to calm his troubled heart, she
sent him a likeness of his favorite child, Magdalena,
at that time an infant of a year old.
She was not disappointed in her hopes. His
secretary, Veit Dietrich, answered the letter,
and said, &ldquo;You have done a good work in sending
the likeness to the doctor; he forgets many
troublesome things in looking at it. He has
hung it on the wall opposite the table at which
we dine. When he first saw it, he did not
recognize it. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said he &lsquo;Lena&rsquo;s complexion
is dark!&rsquo; But now he is remarkably
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
well pleased with it, and the more he looks at
it the better he likes it. <span class="gs">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</span>
I pray you, do not be troubled about the doctor;
he is, thank heaven, well and in good spirits.
For the first two days he was much depressed
respecting his father&rsquo;s death, but has now recovered
his usual vivacity.&rdquo; When, in the
following year, Luther&rsquo;s pious mother was
attacked with a dangerous sickness and his
numerous engagements did not allow him to
visit her, he wrote her a consolatory letter, the
conclusion of which expresses in a very striking
manner the cordial affection which Catharine
and her children entertained for this excellent
woman. &ldquo;My wife and children are praying
for you. They weep and say, &lsquo;Grandmother is
very sick.&rsquo;&rdquo; She also died, to Luther&rsquo;s most
profound regret, on June 30, 1531.</p>
<p>It was not only in seasons of affliction and
distress that Catharine deeply sympathized
with her husband. In times of prosperity and
rejoicing she equally displayed her interest,
and was ever proud of his growing reputation
and of the honors conferred on him.</p>
<p>These are proofs sufficient that their matrimonial
life was happy; yet the foulest slanders
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
were heaped upon them by the enemies of the
cause of which Luther was now the acknowledged
champion.</p>
<p>Luther awarded to his wife the praise of
unconditional obedience, and agreeably to the
custom of the times she always saluted him as
<i>Herr Doctor</i>. During the first years of his
matrimonial life particularly, when he had
recovered from his attacks of melancholy, and
his general health had improved, he was almost
always in excellent spirits. He treated his
domestics in the kindest manner, and his whole
household was conducted in a way which contributed
to the happiness of every member. He
acceded to Catharine&rsquo;s supreme control over
the affairs of the family, and never interfered,
except when he deemed it absolutely necessary.
He often playfully addressed her as <i>Mrs. Doctor
and Professoress</i>, and sometimes as <i>Master
Catharine</i>. All the world knew that this was
but the outpouring of a sportive disposition and
an affectionate heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p class="h2sum">Income&mdash;Expenses&mdash;Hospitality&mdash;Charity&mdash;Diet&mdash;Afflictions&mdash;Despondency&mdash;Journeys&mdash;Death.</p>
<p>Luther&rsquo;s income was disproportionate to
his expenses. He has often said &ldquo;that he
gave more out than he took in.&rdquo; His pay at
this time amounted to but 200 guilders, and his
own family expenses to 500. Besides, he aided
his poor relatives, and was obliged to perform
many expensive journeys on business relating
to the Reformation. His eminent position in
society often subjected him to invitations to
assume the relation of godfather, and this
always levied contributions on his purse. He
was also obliged to make numerous marriage
presents, and almost daily to entertain strangers,
which compelled him to keep a corresponding
number of servants. His expenses were so
great that sometimes he was embarrassed with
considerable debts. He says, &ldquo;I am unfit for
housekeeping; I am made quite poor by the
necessary support of my destitute relations and
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
the daily demands of strangers.&rdquo; In writing
to another friend, he says, &ldquo;You know that I
am quite oppressed by my large domestic
establishment, for through my thoughtlessness
I have, during this year, made debts to the
amount of more than 100 guilders. I have
pledged three silver cups at one place for 50
guilders; but the Lord, who chastises my folly,
will deliver me. Hence it is that Cranach and
Aurifaber will no longer take me as security,
for they observe that I have an empty purse.
I have given them my fourth cup for 12 guilders,
which they have loaned to Herrman. But why
is it that my purse is so completely exhausted&mdash;no,
not quite exhausted; but why am I so
deeply immersed in debt? I believe that no
one will charge me with parsimony, avarice,&rdquo; &amp;c.
He sometimes had the honor of entertaining
persons of exalted rank. Elizabeth, the sister
of Christian II., King of Denmark, who had
fled from her husband on account of his cruel
treatment of her because she had abandoned
popery, and the Duchess Ursula of M&uuml;nsterberg,
an escaped nun, had often been his guests
for upwards of three months at a time, and it
is no small matter for a poor man to entertain
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
a princess. Many monks and nuns who had
escaped from convents had often imposed themselves
on his hospitality, and sometimes shamefully
deceived him. In 1537 he took into his
house his relative and countryman, Agricola,
with his wife and family, and kept them for a
long time, until Luther procured a professorship
for him. Luther&rsquo;s five children were now
growing up, and their education was by no
means neglected, and even the fields which his
wife owned, near Wittenberg and Zoldorf,
demanded no little outlay. To all this was
superadded that peculiar disposition which has,
however, characterized many great minds,
which is, a perfect contempt of all earthly possessions.
The grounds of this he sought and
found in the Bible. When with scorn he rejected
all offers of gold and dignities on condition
of renouncing his faith, which his enemies
made, he did right; but it must be confessed
that as a father of a family he was too careless
about their wants. Thus, when some one reminded
him that he might, at least, lay up a
little property for his family, he replied, &ldquo;That
I shall not do; for otherwise they will not trust
to God or their own exertions, but to their
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
money.&rdquo; Thus he presented all his manuscripts
to the printers, who were at that time also
booksellers, and when they offered him 400
guilders annually for the privilege of printing
and selling his books, he rejected the offer, and
said, &ldquo;I will not sell the grace of God. I
have enough.&rdquo; Only occasionally he asked for
a copy of his books as a present to a friend.
He charged no fee for his lectures. &ldquo;It was
my intention,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;after I was married,
to lecture for pay. But as God anticipated me,
I have all my life sold no copy of my books,
nor read lectures for money. And if it please
God, I will carry this honor to the grave with
me.&rdquo; When the Elector, John the Constant,
in 1529, designed to honor him with a share in
a productive silver mine at Schneeberg as a
compliment for his translation of the Bible, he
replied, &ldquo;It much better becomes me to pay
the amount of my share with a <i>pater noster</i>,
that the ores may continue productive and the
product may be well applied.&rdquo; This he confirmed
soon after, (Sept. 8, 1530,) with these
words, &ldquo;I have never taken a penny for my
translation, and never asked it.&rdquo; And at
another place he says, &ldquo;If I did not feel such a
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
painful concern <i>for his sake who died for me</i>,
the whole world could not give me money
enough to write a book or translate any portion
of the Bible. <i>I am not willing to be rewarded
by the world for my labor; the world is too
poor for that!</i>&rdquo; Melanchthon promised him
1000 guilders compensation if he would finish
the translation of &AElig;sop, begun in 1530, and
dedicate it to some great personage; but
Luther desired to labor exclusively for the
diffusion of the Gospel, and write theological
works, for which he would receive no pay.
Another friend made him a present of 200
guilders, which he generously divided among
poor students. When, in 1529, Bugenhagen
brought him a gift of 100 guilders from a rich
gentleman, he gave Melanchthon the half of it.
As early as 1520, he received a bequest of 150
guilders from Dr. Heinrich Becke of Naumburg,
and in 1521, a person named Marcus Schart
presented him with 50 guilders, which he divided
with his prior, Breisger. When the
Elector, John the Steadfast, in 1542, ordered
a tax to be levied to raise money to carry on
the war against the Turks, and exempted
Luther&rsquo;s property, the latter would not consent
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
to it, but for the sake of the example had property
to the amount of 610 guilders assessed.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a>
Many other similar instances of his remarkable
disinterestedness, which, however, were not
always worthy of imitation, might be mentioned.
He was liberal and benevolent as even few rich
men are, and hence it is that his children
received no large inheritance from him. Thus
on one occasion a very poor man applied to
him for help. He had no money at hand, and
his wife was sick; but he took the donation
which had been made to his infant at its recent
baptism, and gave it to the applicant. The sick
wife, who soon missed the money out of the
savings-box, expressed her displeasure, but
Luther meekly replied, &ldquo;God is rich; he will
provide in some other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At another time, a young man who had
finished his studies, and was about to leave
Wittenberg, made a similar request. Luther
was again destitute of funds. With sincere
sympathy he deplored his inability to aid the
youth; but when he observed his deep distress,
his eye fell on a silver cup which had been presented
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
to him by the Elector. He looked
inquiringly at his wife; her countenance seemed
to reply, no! But he hastily snatched the cup
and gave it to the student. The latter was
much astonished, and was unwilling to take it.
Catharine also, by winks and looks, intimated
to her husband not to press the acceptance of
it on the stranger. But Luther, with a great
effort, pressed the sides of the cup together and
gave it to the young man, saying, &ldquo;I have no
use for a silver cup. Here, take it; carry it
to a goldsmith, and keep all you can get for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luther was indebted to the punctuality,
thrift, and economy of his wife, for the small
property in land, furniture, and books, which
he left at his death. She has been charged
with parsimony as well as with a multitude of
other sins by Luther&rsquo;s enemies, but there is
no evidence to sustain the accusation. If she
was economical when her husband had no
guests in his house&mdash;which was not often the
case&mdash;it rather redounded to her credit, and
arose from necessity. This course was pursued
with his sanction. He was always temperate
in his diet. Sometimes, even when he was in
good health, he partook of no substantial food
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
for four days together. At other times a little
bread and a herring sufficed for a day; or, that
he might study the more intensely, bread and
salt constituted his meal. Of course, at other
times, he lived more generously, but always
within the bounds of moderation.</p>
<p>Catharine not only sympathized most sincerely
with her husband in all his joys and
sorrows, but she herself suffered severe afflictions,
some of which were calculated to fill a
mother&rsquo;s heart with inexpressible anguish.
Some of these have been already alluded to.
In August, 1538, they were both attacked with
fever, and in July, 1539, they providentially
escaped a violent death. Luther had had a
new cellar constructed, which he went to inspect
in company with his wife. They had scarcely
left the cellar, when the ground caved in with
a terrible crash. In loud thanksgivings to
God they expressed their sense of this miraculous
deliverance. In January, 1540, Catharine
was brought nigh to death at the birth of a
child. To Luther&rsquo;s great joy, she gradually
recovered. The death of their second daughter,
Magdalena, in 1542, at the age of fourteen&mdash;the
first, Elizabeth, had died in 1528&mdash;bowed
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
her heart deeply, and overwhelmed her with
sorrow. Scarcely had the pious sufferer endured
these severe visitations with the resignation
becoming a true Christian, when she was
called on to deplore the death of her most intimate
and valuable friend, the wife of Dr.
Jonas. This unexpected event was so much
the more painful to Luther, inasmuch as when
in secret he reflected on his own departure out
of this world, he always reckoned on the wife
of Dr. Jonas as the comforter of his widow and
children.</p>
<p>In 1545, the three sons of Luther and his
yet surviving daughter, Margaretta, were all at
the same time attacked with the measles, and
the latter also suffered in addition, from a
severe and dangerous fever.</p>
<p>About this time, Luther, very unexpectedly
to his friends, determined to leave Wittenberg.
His strength was exhausted by disease, and by
his numerous literary labors. He was disappointed
and chagrined also on various accounts,
and longed for repose. As soon as this became
known, Bugenhagen and others were sent to
him on the part of the University and the town,
whose tears and entreaties prevailed on him to
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
remain for the present. But in July, 1545, he
was bent on carrying out his determination,
and travelled in company with his eldest son,
John, by way of L&ouml;bnitz and Leipzig to Merseburg,
where he visited Prince George, of
Anhalt, whom, on this occasion, he solemnly
consecrated to the office of Coadjutor of the
Chapter of the Cathedral. During his stay in
Leipzig, he wrote (July 28), to his wife, &ldquo;I
should like to arrange it so that it would not
be necessary for me to return to Wittenberg.
My feelings are so alienated that I do not care
any longer about being there. I also wish that
you would sell our house and other property.
I wish you would return the large house to my
gracious master,<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> and it would be better for
you to settle at Zallsdorff whilst I yet live; for
after my death you will hardly find a support
in Wittenberg, hence you had better do it
during my lifetime.&rdquo; Catharine was extremely
surprised at this determination; but as her
husband had enjoined it upon her to inform
Bugenhagen and Melanchthon of his purpose,
and to request the former to take leave of the
congregation in his name, she, at least, complied
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
with this wish. But not so the University.
As soon as the members had learned the purport
of his letter, they sent not only a copy of
it to the Elector, and a letter to his Grace,
beseeching him to influence Luther to return;
but they and the town council also sent Bugenhagen
and Melanchthon, and some other deputies,
as a committee to see him. The Elector
himself wrote to him, promising to render his
condition at Wittenberg more comfortable, and
summoned him to appear at his palace at
Torgau for further conversation on the subject.
Luther instantly obeyed the summons, and
appeared at Torgau. The Elector persuaded
him to return to Wittenberg. Sick and depressed
in heart he arrived there on the 18th
of August, where he was received with open
arms by all his friends.</p>
<p>But this gratification was of short duration
for them and Catharine; for in January, 1546,
completely debilitated by the effects of protracted
sickness, he entered upon a journey of
another character, from which, alas! he never
returned. His youngest sister, Dorothea, was
married to Paul Mackenrot, who was in the
service of the Elector. The family of Mackenrot
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
possessed productive silver-mines in the
duchy of Mansfeld, which excited the envy of
the dukes of Mansfeld, and led them to the
determination of securing to themselves the
entire products of the mines, for before they
had received only the tenth and some other
perquisites. As soon as Luther heard of this
unjust proceeding, he undertook to maintain
the rights of his brother-in-law, and in 1540
wrote to Duke Albert on the subject; but his
intercession was fruitless. In 1542, he renewed
his attempts, but without any favorable
result. In 1545, he travelled to Eisleben and
to Mansfeld on the same mission, but all to no
effect. Soon after, Luther was urgently entreated
by the Dukes themselves (of whom,
Albert was a Protestant, and the other two,
Philip and John George, were still Catholics,)
to appear personally at Eisleben in order to
settle this difficulty as well as some others
existing among them. Although his health
was in a wretched condition, he promised to go.
After he had preached in Wittenberg, the last
time, on January 17, 1546, he took leave of
his friends, and on the 23d, he departed, accompanied
by his three sons; John, 19 years
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
of age, Martin 14, and Paul 13. He passed
through Halle, where he visited his friend, Dr.
Jonas, at that time pastor in that city. Jonas
accompanied him to Eisleben; but as he approached
that city, he was so exhausted that
he fainted, and they were apprehensive of his
death; but he was conveyed to a house where
they rubbed him with warm cloths, and he was
soon restored. He arrived safe at Eisleben on
the 28th, but a violent attack was soon renewed.
Catharine, who on the departure of her husband
could easily have anticipated these attacks, on
having been informed of them by the eldest
son, John, who had been sent back, forwarded
some remedies from her own domestic medicine-chest,
the good effects of which he had often
experienced. On the 1st and 6th of February
he communicated to her the state of his own
health and of the affairs at Mansfeld, and
entreated her to lay aside any undue anxiety
about himself. But he soon expressed an
intense desire to return home. He wrote to
that effect on the 10th, and again in a jocose
style besought her not to be uneasy on his
account. But he was never to see her again.
As he anticipated, he was destined to die in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
place of his birth.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> Although he suffered keenly
from pulmonary affection, he not only preached
four times, but performed much other important
business. But his end had come, and he
died on February 18, 1546, in the 63d year of
his age. Dr. Jonas and the court preacher at
Mansfeld, Michel Coclius, who, with others,
were present at his death, immediately communicated
the melancholy event to the Elector,
and requested his Grace to issue orders respecting
the funeral, as well as to have a letter of
consolation written to his bereaved widow.
The intelligence was conveyed so rapidly to
Torgau, that the Elector, on the same evening
of the day on which Luther died, answered the
letter, and gave immediate orders in relation to
his funeral.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p class="h2sum">Catharine, a Widow&mdash;Her Support&mdash;Sufferings&mdash;Journeys&mdash;Death.</p>
<p>No one was more deeply distressed at his
death than the mourning widow. For more
than twenty years she had lived with him in
uninterrupted harmony; had sought to alleviate
his sufferings, and had shared his joys; and
she was not permitted to see him die nor minister
to his last wants! Even if he did die
among friends, yet she was not there to smooth
his pillow and to perform those tender offices
which an affectionate wife alone knows how to
do. When on the 22d of February the corpse
was conveyed to Wittenberg and deposited in
the castle church, and all the inhabitants of the
city went to meet the melancholy procession,
there stood Catharine weeping, and with her
children looked on her deceased husband.</p>
<p>She survived him nearly seven years, and
cherished his memory most affectionately.
Though his enemies assailed him most virulently
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
when he was no longer present to defend himself,
yet she never allowed her affection to cool
nor her interest in his work and reputation to
abate.</p>
<p>The black velvet cloth which had covered
the funeral car came into the possession of the
widow, and for many years it was preserved
among Luther&rsquo;s posterity as a valuable memento.
Neither did the Elector forget her.
He wrote her a letter of condolence, in which
he sought to comfort her on the grounds of the
happy death of her husband, and the secret,
wise councils of God. At the same time, he
repeated his assurances of his protection of her
and her children.</p>
<p>Although Luther had expressed a desire that
Catharine should remove from Wittenberg,
fearing that after his death she might not be
able to support herself there, yet induced by
good reasons, she resolved to spend the remainder
of her days in that place; for where
could she expect to find better friends than in
Wittenberg? Bugenhagen, Cruciger, Melanchthon,
and others, were still living, who were
her counsellors and comforters; and Wittenberg
was also the place where her sons had
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
already begun their education, and where they
could most advantageously finish it.</p>
<p>Luther had, some time before his death,
made ample provision, consisting of various
kinds of property, for his wife,<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> which she was
to hold independent of her children, in the
event of her remaining a widow. In the document
conveying it to her he speaks of her in
the most exalted terms as a pious woman, a
faithful wife, and an affectionate mother. The
property thus left was far from being sufficient
to maintain the widow and her children. The
Elector of Saxony, agreeably to his promise,
contributed to her support. The dukes of
Mansfeld and the King of Denmark also
liberally came to her help. The Elector, John
Frederick, of Saxony, who had already paid
the funeral expenses, thus wrote to Dr. Schurf,
Professor of Medicine and Rector of the University:
&ldquo;And as we have heard that the
widow of the sainted Luther is in need of pecuniary
assistance, ... we send you by
this messenger 100 gold Groschen for her use.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
He also wrote to Cruciger and Melanchthon,
the guardians of the children, to select a teacher
for the two younger sons, Martin and Paul,
with whom they should also board. He directed
that with regard to the oldest son, John, they
should wait six months longer, to ascertain
whether he was inclined or qualified to study
a learned profession, and if not, the Elector
promised to give him employment in his palace
as a clerk or secretary.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> To enable the guardians
to execute his wishes with regard to the
children, the Elector sent them 2000 guilders.
He likewise afterwards sent the same sum to
the widow. The dukes of Mansfeld, for whose
benefit Luther had undertaken many journeys
and suffered much trouble, were not behind; in
the same year they established a fund of 2000
guilders for the benefit of the widow and children,
from which they drew an annual interest
of 100 guilders. Part of the capital only was
paid, for when Catharine died, in 1552, 1000
guilders still stood to her credit. The year
after Luther&rsquo;s death, Christian III., King of
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
Denmark, transferred for her benefit 50 dollars,
the remainder of a sum which he had previously
granted to Luther and several of his friends.
Catharine wrote to the King, expressing her
profound gratitude for this act of benevolence.</p>
<p>But she was soon called on to experience
additional sorrows. The Smalcald War had
already broken out in 1546, which brought
desolation into many peaceful and happy
families. Catharine did not escape the general
calamity. The Elector, John Frederick, who
would certainly have done more for her, was
taken prisoner at the battle of Muhlberg, April
24, 1547; Wittenberg was besieged on the 5th
of May, and on the 25th, Charles V., with his
Spanish troops, entered the city as conqueror.
All the faithful subjects of the Elector, and
many persons who had embraced the doctrines
of the Reformation, had left before the siege.
The widow of the Reformer, with her children,
could not possibly remain behind. She accompanied
Dr. George Major, Professor of Theology,
to Magdeburg, and thence, sustained by the
town council of Helmstadt, she went under
Melanchthon&rsquo;s protection to Brunswick, from
whence Dr. Major was to conduct her to
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
Copenhagen. Here she expected further protection
and support from the King of Denmark,
as her illustrious benefactor, the Elector of
Saxony, could no longer assist her. But she
did not proceed farther than Gifhorn, near
Brunswick; for a proclamation appeared promising
a safe return and the secure possession
of their property to all who had left the country.
It seemed best to her, as well as to Melanchthon,
to return to the home she had abandoned.
But her life, from this period, was an unbroken
series of sorrows. The assistance she had formerly
received from the liberality of the Elector
was withdrawn; the annual contribution of the
King of Denmark&mdash;although he had promised
further help&mdash;had not been sent since 1548,
and her small real estate was loaded with taxes.
It would have been difficult for her to support
herself and four children if she had not, some
time subsequently, mortgaged her little farm at
Zillsdorff for 400 guilders, and pawned some
silver-ware for 600 guilders. She also rented
out several rooms in her house, as her husband
had done, and boarded the occupants, and thus
she contrived to gain a meagre subsistence.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the year 1548, she
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
travelled with Melanchthon to Leipzig, in order
to solicit from the imperial assessor some diminution
of the oppressive war tax. Melanchthon
also wrote to the King of Denmark, entreating
him to continue the annual contribution which
he made during Luther&rsquo;s lifetime. Bugenhagen
wrote similar letters to his Majesty, begging
him, for Luther&rsquo;s sake, to come to the help of
&ldquo;the poor widow and her children.&rdquo; But as
these repeated appeals were fruitless, she herself
wrote to him, October 6, 1550. In this
letter, she calls to his mind the services which
her illustrious husband had rendered to the
cause of Christianity, and his Majesty&rsquo;s former
liberality to him. In pathetic terms she represents
her destitute condition and the severity
of the times, occasioned by the existing wars.
She says, &ldquo;Your Imperial Majesty is the only
king on earth to whom we poor Christians can
fly for protection, and God will doubtless richly
reward your Majesty for the kindness you
have bestowed on poor Christian preachers and
their widows and children.&rdquo; This letter did
not immediately produce the desired result.
Two years afterwards, when most sorely pressed
by want, she repeated her entreaty, and wrote
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
again. In this letter she complains of her
forsaken condition, and declares that she had
been more unkindly treated by professed friends
than enemies. She writes in a deeply desponding
tone, and seems to be on the brink of
despair. Bugenhagen seconded this appeal to
the King, and it was successful; a contribution
was received which relieved her immediate
wants and comforted her desponding heart.</p>
<p>Luther&rsquo;s exalted merits were not always recognized,
at least, not in the way in which they
should have been. The widow of the man who
conferred favors on thousands at the expense
of extraordinary self-sacrifice, often pined in
misery, and paid the severe penalty of his disinterestedness
and liberality. With much truth
could it be said in a discourse commemorative
of her virtues: &ldquo;During the war she wandered
from place to place with her orphan
children, enduring the most trying privations
and perils, and, besides the numerous trials of
her widowhood, she also encountered much
ingratitude from many, and she was often
shamefully deceived by those even from whom
she had a right to expect kindnesses on account
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
of the inappreciable services of her husband to
the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the peace of Passau (July 31, 1552),
security was re-established for the Protestants,
and the former elector of Saxony was restored
to liberty.</p>
<p>About this time a contagious disease broke
out in Wittenberg, and all the members of the
University removed to Torgau. Catharine also
determined to leave the place with her two
younger sons, Martin and Paul (John was
studying at Konigsberg), and her only daughter,
Margaret, was to follow them a short time
after. On the journey the horses became
unmanageable and ran away with the carriage.
Catharine, more concerned about the children
than her own safety, and with the hope of
facilitating their escape, leaped out of the
vehicle and fell violently into a ditch full of
water. This painful accident gave such a
severe shock to her system that she was conveyed
to Torgau in a very weak condition,
where she took her bed and never left it alive.
Her illness increased from day to day, and
soon assumed the decided character of consumption.
Two months after, December 20, 1552,
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
she died in the 54th year of her age. Her
funeral was attended by an immense crowd of
persons. The professors, students, and citizens,
united in demonstrations of respect for the
deceased widow of the illustrious reformer.</p>
<p>During the whole period of her sickness, she
comforted herself with the promises of God&rsquo;s
word. She heartily prayed for a peaceful
departure out of this vale of tears. She frequently
commended the Church and her children
to the continued protection of God, and
her daily supplication was that the true doctrine,
which the Lord had given to the world
through her deceased husband, might be transmitted
uncorrupted to posterity.</p>
<p>A plain monument in the <i>city church</i> of
Torgau designates the place where her remains
repose. On the monument or tombstone there
is a recumbent statue, the size of life, with an
open Bible pressed to the heart. The inscription
is, Anno 1552, den 20 December. Ist in
Gott selig entschlaffen alhier Zu Torgau Herrn
D. Martin Luther&rsquo;s Seligen hinterlassene Wittwe
Katharina von Bora.</p>

<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p class="h2sum">Luther&rsquo;s Children&mdash;Domestic Character&mdash;Catharine.</p>
<p>Catharine had been the mother of six children,
three sons and three daughters. 1. <i>John</i>,
born June 7, 1526; studied law, and became a
civil officer in the service of the Elector of
Saxony; died October 27, 1575, aged 50 years.
2. <i>Elizabeth</i>; born December 10, 1527, died
August 3, 1528. 3. <i>Magdalena</i>; born May 4,
1529; died September 20, 1542, aged 14; 4.
<i>Martin</i>; born November 7, 1531&mdash;studied
theology; died March 3, 1565, aged 34. 5.
<i>Paul</i>; born January 28, 1533&mdash;studied medicine,
and became court physician to the Elector
of Saxony; died March 8, 1593, aged 61 years.
6. <i>Margaret</i>; born December 17, 1534; died
1570, aged 36 years.</p>
<p>Luther was accustomed to say, &ldquo;The more
children we have, the more happiness we enjoy.
They are the loveliest fruits and bonds of the
domestic life.&rdquo; He was never more happy than
in the circle of his family, and whoever saw
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
him there forgot that he was the man who
spoke without fear or trembling with emperors,
kings, and nobles. He was much averse to
noisy entertainments. &ldquo;I lose too much time
at such festal gatherings with the citizens. I
do not know what demon it is that prevents me
from abandoning them, and yet they do me
much harm,&rdquo; said he. It was in the bosom of
his family and in the company of a few select
friends in which he sought the most agreeable
relaxation from the burdensome cares of his
life, and gathered fresh vigor for his arduous
labors. Surrounded by his wife and children,
and by the side of his intimate friends, as
Spalatin, Bugenhagen, Cruciger, Melanchthon,
and a few others, he took part in the innocent
amusements of life with a heart full of gratitude
to God, who favored him with these evening
relaxations. In 1543, he celebrated his 62d
birthday, and invited Melanchthon, Bugenhagen,
Cruciger, George Major, and Eber; it
was the last time he celebrated that day. Subjects
of solemn import came up for conversation.
Luther, in a prophetic spirit, said, &ldquo;As
long as I live, with God&rsquo;s help, there will be
no danger, and Germany will continue peaceful;
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
but when I die, then pray! There will be
really need of prayer; our children shall have
to grasp their weapons, and there will be sad
times for Germany. Hence, I say, pray diligently
after my death.&rdquo; He then turned to
Eber particularly, and said, &ldquo;Your name is
Paul; hence be careful, after Paul&rsquo;s example,
to preserve and defend the doctrine of that
Apostle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luther was a man of a sociable disposition,
always enjoying conversation enlivened by wit
and edifying anecdote. He excelled in spicy
conversation himself, and was the life of every
circle of distinguished men. But he especially
found the sweetest enjoyment in conversation
with his wife and children, and often, too, from
the innocent prattle of the latter he derived no
ordinary edification. When his heart was sad,
he would take one of them into his arms and
tenderly caress it. Thus, on more than one
occasion, he took the youngest child, and,
pressing it to his bosom, with deep emotion
exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah! what a blessing these little
ones are, of which the vulgar and the obstinate
are not worthy.&rdquo; On another occasion he said,
&ldquo;I am richer than all papal theologians in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
world, for I am contented with little. I have
a wife and six children, whom God has bestowed
on me; such treasures the papistic divines do
not deserve.&rdquo; Little Martin was once playing
with a dog; &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Luther, who took a religious
view of the most ordinary circumstances,
and thus also in social life he became the
teacher of those around him; &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;this child preaches God&rsquo;s word in its actions;
for God says, &lsquo;Have, then, dominion over the
fishes of the sea and the beasts of the earth,&rsquo;
for the dog suffers himself to be governed by
the child.&rdquo; On one occasion, this same child
was speaking of the enjoyments of heaven, and
said &ldquo;In heaven, loaves of bread grow on the
trees.&rdquo; The father replied with a smile, &ldquo;The
life of children is the happiest and best of all,
for they have no worldly cares; they know
nothing about fanatics and errorists in the
church, and have only pure thoughts and
pleasant reflections.&rdquo; He was amusing himself
one day with the child, and said, &ldquo;We were all
once in this same happy state of mind in Eden;
simple, upright, without guile or hypocrisy&mdash;we
were sincere, just as this child speaks of
God, and in earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>At another time, he remarked that Martin
afforded him special delight because he was his
youngest child. &ldquo;We do not find such natural
kindness in old persons; it does not flow so
freely and fully. That which is colored or
feigned loses our favor; it is not so impressive;
it does not afford as much pleasure as that which
springs up naturally from the heart. Hence
children are the best playmates; they speak
and do everything sincerely and naturally. How
Abraham&rsquo;s heart must have beat,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;when he was called on to sacrifice his son! I
do not think he told Sarah anything about it! I
could contend with God if he demanded anything
similar of me.&rdquo; Here the maternal feeling of
Catharine was roused, and she observed, &ldquo;I
cannot believe that God could demand of
parents the slaughter of their children.&rdquo; He
removed her objections by reminding her of the
greater sacrifice which God the Father made
by offering his own son as a ransom for our sins.</p>
<p>Margaretta was once speaking to her father
of Jesus, the angels, and heaven. Deeply
moved, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh! how much better
than ours is the faith and life of children! The
word which they hear they accept with joy and
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
without any doubts, and are happy. But we
old fools have painful anxieties, and dispute
long. Well has Christ said, &lsquo;Unless ye be
converted and become as little children, ye
cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.&rsquo;&rdquo; Christmas,
particularly, was a season of joyful festival
in Luther&rsquo;s family. No annual fair, such
as are to this day held in Germany, passed by
in which he did not purchase presents for his
children. With deep regret he wrote to his
wife, when he was in Torgau, in 1532, that he
could find nothing in that town to buy for the
little ones at home.</p>
<p>Vocal and instrumental music was a frequent
source of family entertainment, especially after
supper. Luther himself accompanied it with
the flute or the lute, both of which he played
skilfully. He often invited accomplished
singers, and thus held family concerts in his
house. When his time and the weather permitted,
he repaired to what was afterwards
called <i>Luther&rsquo;s Spring</i>, which he himself discovered,
and over which, after his marriage, he
had a neat summer-house erected. He spent
many an hour of pleasant enjoyment in his
garden, with his wife engaged with her needle,
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
and the children playing around him. Here he
often invited his friends to exhibit to them the
luxuriant fruit of his own cultivation. As the
children increased in years, especially the sons,
he made them his companions. He took them
with him on his numerous journeys, and they
accompanied him on his last and eventful tour
to the place of his birth, and, as it proved, the
place of his death. That he might enjoy the
society of his wife as much as possible, he
pursued his labors with her at his side or invited
her into his study. She often copied his
manuscripts for the press, and otherwise rendered
aid in writing. He communicated to her
everything of special interest relating to the
progress of the Reformation not only orally
when at home, but by letter during his absence.
He also frequently read aloud for her entertainment,
and sometimes even extracts from
the books of his opponents, such as Erasmus
and others. He often gave her striking passages
of Scripture to commit to memory, such
as Psalm 31, which was particularly applicable
to her condition after his death, just as though
he had anticipated it years before. She, on
the other hand, often urged him to the performance
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
of pressing duties, especially answering
letters. Her participation in his affairs was
kindly reciprocated by him. He patiently
listened to all her requests, and in his letters
executed many of her commissions. It was
only when he desired to complete some work
which allowed no postponement that he dispensed
with her presence. At such times, he
locked himself in his study for days, and ate
nothing but bread and salt, that he might, without
interruption, pursue the work in hand.
This often occurred, and he would not allow
himself to be disturbed. On one occasion he
had been thus locked up for three days; she
sought him everywhere&mdash;shed bitter tears&mdash;knocked
at all the doors and called him, but
no one answered. She had the door opened by
a locksmith, and found her husband profoundly
absorbed in the explanation of the 22d Psalm.
She was proceeding to reprimand him for
occasioning such painful anxiety, but he was
impatient of the interruption to his studies,
pointed to the Bible, and said, &ldquo;Do you think,
then, that I am doing anything bad? do you
not know that I must work as long as it is day,
for the night cometh in which no man can
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
work?&rdquo; But his tone and look sufficiently
indicated to her that he was, after all, not
unduly excited. At his social assemblies, his
walks for recreation, and short excursions into
the country, she was his inseparable companion
as often as circumstances permitted. When
numerous business calls necessarily compelled
him to leave home, he wrote to her the most
affectionate and often the most humorous letters.</p>
<p>The birth of his first child (June 7, 1526,)
afforded him peculiar gratification. He communicated
the fact to many of his correspondents
in a strain of pleasant humor, and, of
course, received their congratulations in return.
The child was baptized soon after birth by Dr.
R&ouml;rer, and named <i>John</i> by the grandfather.
Bugenhagen, Jonas, and the painter, Cranach,
senior, were his godfathers. From his earliest
years this boy excited the liveliest hopes in his
parents on account of his uncommon mental
qualities, and it was he who gave occasion to
the preparation by the father of several excellent
books for children. Luther possessed the
rare faculty of letting himself down to the
capacity of children without himself becoming
a child. This son&rsquo;s name often occurs in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
letters of Luther, and he is always mentioned
as a lad of uncommon promise and an agreeable
plaything to his father and mother. He thus
writes to Hausman: &ldquo;Besides this, there is
nothing new, except that my Lord has blessed
my Kate and made her a present of a healthy
son. Thanks and praise for his unspeakable
goodness. Mother and child send their respects
to you.&rdquo; Sometime after he wrote to Spalatin,
&ldquo;My little Hans salutes you. He is now
teething, and begins to scold everybody about
him with the most amiable reproaches. Kate
also wishes you every blessing, and particularly
that you also may have a little Spalatin, who
may teach you what she boasts of having learned
from her boy, viz: the joys of matrimonial life,
of which the Pope and his satellites are not
worthy.&rdquo; Luther&rsquo;s friends were much attached
to this child on account of his amiable disposition,
and sent him many presents suitable to
his age. When the boy was yet but four years
old, his father wrote to him the following letter:
&ldquo;Grace and peace in Christ, my dearest little
son. It pleases me much to hear that you love
to learn and to pray. Continue in this good
way, my child; when I come home I will bring
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
you a beautiful present. I know where there
is a beautiful garden into which many children
go. They wear gilded garments and gather all
manner of fruit from under the trees; they
sing, leap, and are happy. They also have
beautiful little horses with golden bridles and
silver saddles. I asked the man who owns the
garden what sort of children they were. He
replied, &lsquo;They are children who love to pray,
to learn and serve God.&rsquo; Then I said, &lsquo;My
dear sir, I also have a son called little Hans
Luther; may he not also go into the garden,
that he, too, may eat these beautiful apples and
pears, and ride these nice horses and play with
these good children?&rsquo; He answered, &lsquo;Every
little boy who loves to pray and learn, and is
good, may come into the garden, Lippus and
Jost<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> also, and if they all come together they
shall also have all sorts of musical instruments,
and dance and shoot with little crossbows.&rsquo;
And he pointed out to me a meadow in the
garden suited for a children&rsquo;s playground, and
there were hanging golden instruments of
music and beautiful silver crossbows. But it
was yet early, and the children had not yet
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
eaten their breakfast, hence I could not wait to
see the children dance and play, and I said to
the man, &lsquo;Ah, my dear sir, I will go without
delay and write all this to my beloved little
son, Hans, that he may diligently pray, learn
well, and be pious, so that he, too, may come
into this garden; but he has a little sister,
Lehna, whom he must bring with him.&rsquo; Then
the man said, &lsquo;It must be so; go and write to
him.&rsquo; For this reason, dear son, learn and
pray, and tell Lippus and Jost also to do the
same, and then you shall all go into the garden.
I commend you to God. Kiss Lehna for me.
Your dear Father, M. L., 1530.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prudent discipline of the mother, exercised
with tender earnestness, gradually developed
the moral and intellectual faculties of
this youth in an eminent degree, and this, combined
with his religious and scientific attainments,
as subsequently displayed, afforded the
father unspeakable gratification. In his 15th
year this youth received the most honorable
testimonial of his industry in study and general
excellence of character from John William, the
second son of the Elector, John Frederick,
promising further encouragement and aid in
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
the prosecution of his studies. When he was
properly qualified by preliminary attainments
to attend a higher school, he was sent to the
Gymnasium at Torgau. Afterwards, he studied
law at Wittenberg and Konigsberg, and on his
return from his travels in various countries of
Europe he was appointed Court Councillor by
John William, in which office he subsequently
served under the brother of the Elector. He
was dismissed at his own request, and entered
the service of Duke Albert in Konigsberg, and
died October 28, 1575, aged 49 years.</p>
<p>His second child, Elizabeth, was born during
the prevalence of the contagious disease in
Wittenberg before alluded to. She lived only
nine months, and Luther&rsquo;s grief at her death
was excessive. He thus writes to Hausman:
&ldquo;Never could I have believed a parent&rsquo;s heart
could be so tender towards children; seldom
have I mourned so deeply. My sorrow is like
that of a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The death of his third child, Magdalena, at
the age of 14, was a severe affliction. She was
a girl of unusual promise; amiable, gifted, and
pious. Her complete resignation to the will of
God&mdash;her vivid conception of the doctrines of
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
the Bible&mdash;her strong faith in the Saviour,
and her filial and religious virtues, distinguished
her far above many of her tender years. She
was for a long time confined to bed, and she
felt that her end was rapidly drawing nigh.
She ardently desired to see her brother John,
who was a student at the academy at Torgau.
The father gratified her wish, and despatched
a messenger to summon the absent son to the
death-bed of his sister. Luther, as far as was
possible, watched by the side of the dying
child. Although the trial was severe, his
patient submission to the will of God was characteristic
of the man and the Christian.
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; sighed he, &ldquo;I love this child most
tenderly; but O, God, as it is thy will to take
her to thyself, I cheerfully resign her into thy
hands.&rdquo; Then he advanced to the bed and
spoke to the suffering child, &ldquo;Magdalena, my
daughter, you would willingly remain with your
father on earth, and yet you also desire to go
to your Father in heaven.&rdquo; On which she
replied, &ldquo;Yes, dearest father, just as it pleases
God.&rdquo; He continued, &ldquo;Dearest child, the
spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.&rdquo; Overcome
by emotion, he turned away and said:
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
&ldquo;Oh! how I love this suffering child! but if
the flesh is now so strong, what will then the
spirit be!&mdash;well, whether we live or die, we are
the Lord&rsquo;s.&rdquo; When she was breathing her
last, the mother, overwhelmed with sorrow,
retired from the couch; Luther threw himself
on his knees, wept convulsively, and implored
God to release the child from suffering; he
then took her by the hand&mdash;and she died.
The father at once had recourse to the Scriptures
to seek consolation for his grievous loss.
He opened the book, and the passage, Romans
14; 7, first arrested his attention: &ldquo;For none of
us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.&rdquo;
This expressive passage was as a balsam
to his wounded heart. When the body was
deposited in the coffin, he said, &ldquo;Thou dear
Magdalena! how happy thou art! O, dear
Magdalena, thou wilt rise again, and wilt shine
like a star, yea, like the sun.&rdquo; But the coffin
having been made too small, he said, &ldquo;This
bed is too small for her, now that she is dead.
I am indeed joyful in the spirit, but after the
flesh I am very sad; the flesh is slow to come
to the trial; this separation troubles us exceedingly;
it is a marvellous thing to know that
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
she is certainly happy, and yet for me to be so
sad!&rdquo; When the people came to attend the
funeral, and, according to custom, addressed
the Doctor, and said that they sincerely condoled
with him in this affliction, he said, &ldquo;You
should rejoice: I have sent a saint to heaven,
yea, a living saint. O! if only such a death
were ours! such a death I would be willing to
die this moment!&rdquo; When one said, &ldquo;That is
indeed true; yet we all wish to retain our
relatives,&rdquo; Luther replied, &ldquo;Flesh is flesh and
blood is blood. I rejoice that she has passed
over; I experience no sadness but that of the
flesh.&rdquo; Again, he said to others present, &ldquo;Be
not grieved, I have sent a saint to heaven, yea,
I have sent two.&rdquo; When she was buried, he
said, &ldquo;It is the resurrection of the flesh,&rdquo; and
when they returned from the funeral, he said,
&ldquo;Now is my daughter provided for, both as to
body and soul. We Christians have no cause
to complain; we know that it must be thus.
We are perfectly assured of eternal life; for
God, who, through his Son and for the sake of
his Son, has promised it unto us, cannot lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the whole of this trying event
Luther showed all the tenderness of an affectionate
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
father, and all the resignation of a
Christian.</p>
<p>His second son, Martin, was tenderly cherished
by the father. He himself feared that
the child would be spoiled by too much affectionate
attention and favoritism. In reference
to this, he said, &ldquo;The love of parents is always
stronger for the younger than the elder children,
and the more they require the care and protection
of the parents the more dear are they to
them. Thus, my Martin is now my dearest
treasure, because he demands more of my
attention and solicitude. John and Magdalena
can walk and talk and can ask for what they
want, and do not require so much watchful
nursing.&rdquo; But afterwards, Luther&rsquo;s anxieties
about him were very great. &ldquo;He is rather a
wild bird,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and he occasions me much
solicitude.&rdquo; But Martin, who was not without
talents, studied theology, and it was only continued
ill-health that prevented him from publicly
assuming the office of a preacher. He
spent his life in private teaching. In an
obituary notice of him, it is said that &ldquo;he possessed
such strong mental faculties and such
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
striking oratorical powers, as even to have
excited the admiration of his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the third son, Paul, when yet a child,
Luther thus spoke: &ldquo;He is destined to fight
against the Turks,&rdquo; alluding to the energy of
character then observed in him, and which was
afterwards so strikingly developed. And truly,
this Paul, endowed as he was with unusual
decision and unshaken perseverance, was the
most gifted of Luther&rsquo;s sons, even if he did not
in all respects possess the heroic spirit of his
father. He was not only a zealous promoter
of the science of Alchemy, so highly prized at
that day, but he was a distinguished chemist,
and succeeded, by his assiduous labors, in
making many useful discoveries in Chemistry
and Medicine. He also possessed a thorough
knowledge of ancient languages. He was
devoted with all his heart to the religious doctrines
which his father restored, and defended
them with zeal and ability. He was so strenuously
attached to the orthodox system of
theology, that he once refused a very flattering
call to the University of Jena on account of the
presumed heresies which the theologian, Victorine
Striegel, had promulgated at that seat
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
of learning, and he soon afterwards received
the appointment of private physician to John
Frederick II., at Gotha. In 1568 he served Joachim
II., of Brandenburg, in the same capacity,
by whom he was elevated to the rank of Councillor,
and richly rewarded. Afterwards (1571), he
was employed by the Elector, August, and his
successor, Christian I., at Dresden. The former
not only honored him by inviting him to
be sponsor to his children, but also presented
him with a farm, which, however, never came
into the possession of his family, inasmuch as
the subsequent times, during which the Calvinistic
Chancellor, Crell, held the helm of affairs,
were not favorable to the prosperity of the
sternly Lutheran Paul Luther. This same
Calvinistic spirit, finally, was the occasion of
his retiring into private life in 1590. He
moved to Leipzig, where he died in 1593.
At the baptism of this son, Luther said, &ldquo;I
have named him Paul; for St. Paul has taught
us many great and glorious doctrines, and
hence I have named my son after him. God
grant that he may have the gifts and grace of
the great Apostle! If it please God, I will
send all my sons away from home! If any one
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
of them has a taste for the military profession,
I will send him to Field-Marshal L&ouml;ser; if any
one wishes to study, him I will send to Jonas
and Philip; if any one is inclined towards
labor, him I will send to a farmer.&rdquo; But afterwards,
when he became better acquainted with
their disposition, he changed his mind. &ldquo;God
forbid,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that my sons should ever
devote themselves to the study of the law; that
would be my last wish. John will be a theologian;
Martin is good for nothing, and about
him I have great fears; Paul must fight against
the Turks.&rdquo; But history teaches us that his
wishes were not gratified. He himself subsequently
advised Paul to study medicine, and
the example of John induced all the educated
sons of Luther&rsquo;s children for several generations
to study law.</p>
<p>The sixth child, Margaret, who entered into
a happy matrimonial alliance, was dangerously
attacked with fever after the measles, from
which her brother suffered at the same time.
Her father was much alarmed about her condition,
but comforted himself with the thought
that she would be taken out of this present evil
world. She married George V. Kuhlheim, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
civil officer in the Prussian service, who was a
pious man and a most ardent admirer of Luther,
and especially of his writings, of which his
favorite one was &ldquo;Luther&rsquo;s Exposition of the
Book of Genesis.&rdquo; So profound was his reverence
for the Reformer, that the fact was thought
worthy of being mentioned in the sermon
preached at his funeral. His youngest son
must have inherited his father&rsquo;s disposition and
character, for he always esteemed it the highest
possible honor to be &ldquo;the grandson of the
great Luther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not known to what extent Catharine
took part in the education of her children; but
a woman of her mild and amiable temper and
strong decision of character must have contributed
much to the proper training of her offspring.
These prominent traits exercised a
subduing influence even on her husband; and
Erasmus, who was at this time bitterly opposed
to him, says, &ldquo;Since Luther&rsquo;s marriage, he
begins to be more mild, and does not rave so
fearfully with his pen as formerly.&rdquo; Presuming
this to be true, it speaks well for the character
of Catharine as a woman and a wife.</p>
<p>Luther not only employed special teachers
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
for his children, but also instructed them himself,
notwithstanding his numerous other engagements.
He says, &ldquo;Though I am a Doctor
of Divinity, still I have not yet come out of the
school for children, and do not yet rightly understand
the ten commandments, the creed, and
the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, but study them daily, and
recite the catechism with my little Hans and
Magdalena.&rdquo; For years he superintended their
instruction, diligently watching their progress,
and often giving them tasks to perform. But,
above all, he was solicitous about their religious
and moral training, agreeably to his own sound
principle. The father must speak out of the
children. The proper instruction of children is
their most direct way to heaven, and hell is
not more easily earned than by neglecting
them! They were taught to pray and to read
the Scriptures and other devotional books in
the presence of the family. Particularly during
their meals did he address them in impressive,
paternal admonitions. Morning and evening
he assembled his numerous family, house-teachers,
guests, and domestics, to worship.
When it is elsewhere said that Luther &ldquo;daily
spent three hours in private devotion,&rdquo; it must
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
be restricted to the period of the Diet of Augsburg,
when he was concealed at Coburg.</p>
<p>Luther, during all his life, was a man of
prayer. Although he was opposed to mechanical
formality in regard to special times and
seasons, as he had been taught in the church
of Rome, yet he maintained a certain order and
regularity in the performance of this Christian
duty. Matthesius, one of his biographers, and
a cotemporary, says, &ldquo;Every morning and
evening, and often during meals, he engaged
in prayer. Besides this, he repeated the smaller
catechism and read the Psalter. <span class="gs">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</span> In all
important undertakings, prayer was the beginning,
middle, and end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hold,&rdquo; says Luther, &ldquo;my prayer to be
stronger than Satan himself, and if that were
not the case it would long since have been quite
different with Luther. If I remit prayer a
single day, I lose a large portion of the fire of
faith.&rdquo; His writings contain many sparkling
gems on the subject of prayer.</p>
<p>Fondly as he was attached to his children,
yet he never showed a culpable indifference to
their errors, and, least of all, when they were
unruly or displayed anything like ingratitude
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
or deception. On one occasion when John, at
twelve years of age, was guilty of a gross impropriety,
he would not allow him to come into
his presence for three days, and paid no regard
to the intercessions of the tender mother and
of his intimate friends, Jonas and Cruciger, but
forgave him only after he had repented of his
fault and humbly begged for pardon. He said,
&ldquo;I would rather have a dead son than a rude
and naughty living one. Paul has not in vain
said, &lsquo;A bishop must be one who ruleth well
his own house, having his children in subjection,
so that other people may be edified, witnessing
a good example, and not be offended.&rsquo; We
ministers are elevated to such a high position
in order to set a good example to others. But
our uncivil children give offence to other
people. Our boys wish to take advantage of
our position and privileges, and sin openly.
People do not inform me of the faults of mine,
but conceal it from me. The common saying
is fulfilled, &lsquo;We do not know the mischief done
in our own families; we only discover it when
it has become the town-talk.&rsquo; Hence we must
chastise them, and not connive at their follies.&rdquo;
Once, when he saw a youth of fine personal
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
appearance and uncommon abilities, but of corrupt
morals, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah! how much
evil an over indulgence occasions! Children
are spoiled by allowing them too much liberty;
hence I shall not overlook the faults of my son
John, nor shall I be as familiar with him hereafter
as with his little sister.&rdquo; But Luther,
though he received from his father a severe
training, and was roughly treated at school,
was too well acquainted with human nature not
to know that undue severity in all things
created a cowardly, slavish fear in the minds
of some children, and obstinacy and dissimulation
in others. Hence he pursued the golden
medium, and tried to accomplish his purpose by
kind and yet earnest admonitions. &ldquo;I will not
chastise Hans too severely, or he will become
shy of me and hate me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We must
take care to teach the young, to find pleasure
in that which is good; for that which is forced
out of them by stripes will not be profitable,
and, if this is carried to excess, they will only
continue good as long as they feel the lash.
But by admonition and judicious chastisement,
they learn to fear God more than the rod. We
must often <i>stammer</i> with children, and in all
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
good things come down to a level with them,
that is, we must be tender, affectionate, and
condescending, and, if that is of no avail, then
we may employ severity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he saw his wife or children suffering,
his sympathizing heart often found relief in
tears. &ldquo;I love my Catharine,&rdquo; he would say,
&ldquo;I love her more than I do myself. I would
rather die myself than she and the children
should die.&rdquo; It was only when the cause of
religion was concerned that the dearest object
on earth was not too dear; for the honor of
religion and truth, he would have sacrificed wife
and children. Deeply penetrated with this
sentiment, the magnanimous Reformer, when
he had already become the father of two children,
could most cordially say, in the spirit of
Christ&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Let them take my life, property,
reputation, children, and wife&mdash;let them
all go&mdash;the kingdom of God is still ours.&rdquo; His
heroic hymn, &ldquo;Eine feste Burg ist unser
Gott,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> sufficiently shows his feelings on this
subject.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p class="h2sum">Character of Catharine.</p>
<p>It must be acknowledged that there is
nothing remarkably striking in the history of
Catharine de Bora, considered apart from her
relation to her illustrious husband. She was
distinguished by no extraordinary talents or
surprising act of heroism after her marriage;
she has left no literary monument to perpetuate
her memory, nor any public institution founded
by her munificence. She was nothing more
than the &ldquo;virtuous&rdquo; woman so eloquently
described by King Solomon in the last chapter
of the Book of Proverbs, but she was that in
an eminent degree. A noble dignity and a
temperate self-reliance were the fundamental
traits of her character. Hence, though dependent
on others for support, she possessed sufficient
independence of mind to reject several
brilliant offers of marriage, and showed herself
worthy of Luther. Her resolution to exchange
the noiseless cloister for a life of honorable and
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
useful activity in the disturbed world without,
displayed not only a noble courage in the certain
anticipation of poverty and persecution,
but also a strong confidence in God. It is more
than probable that she read many of Luther&rsquo;s
writings as soon as they appeared, not actuated
by a blind curiosity, but with a sincere desire
to ascertain the truth, and to derive from them
instruction for heart and head. Afterwards,
during her married life, she took every opportunity
of correcting and enlarging her religious
views. Although, as the result of the spirit of
that age and of her previous monastic training,
she was not profoundly educated, yet Luther
esteemed her as a woman possessing a noble,
dignified, independent spirit, in whose feelings
and opinions he found an echo of his own.
Pious, in the proper sense of the word, she
found her highest enjoyment in solitary communion
with God, and those hours which she
devoted to the attentive reading of the Scriptures
were always the most happy. To this
profitable exercise she was often exhorted by
her husband, and she followed his advice. Said
she, &ldquo;I hear a great deal of the Scriptures, and
read them diligently every day.&rdquo; In writing
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
to Jonas on one occasion, Luther says, &ldquo;She is
a diligent reader of the Bible; she shows deep
earnestness in this duty.&rdquo; She faithfully
attended the public means of grace also, and
with her Christian brothers and sisters worshipped
God in the sanctuary. She was devotedly
attached to the doctrines of the Reformation,
and one of her dying prayers was for
their preservation in purity to the end of time.
She never neglected her <i>domestic</i> duties. To
her husband, in all the relations of his active
life, she was the most affectionate companion;
in his sickness, the most faithful nurse; in his
troubles, the most tender comforter: to her
children, she was a most gentle mother; in her
household affairs she was a model to all in
regard to cleanliness, order, and neatness; to
her domestics and dependants, a condescending
and indulgent mistress. She was liberal without
extravagance, economical without meanness,
hospitable without ostentation. Her questions
and opinions, still preserved in Luther&rsquo;s
writings, show a strong desire for mental
improvement, an enlightened understanding, a
clear and dispassionate penetration. This
elevated, intellectual character of Catharine,
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
connected with her lofty independence and self-confidence,
created a distaste for the company
of other less cultivated and less dignified ladies,
for the glory of her husband also encircled her
head, and the house of Luther was the central
point of union of the distinguished men of that
day. Hence we need not wonder that, by the
envious, she was accused of pride. It is true,
that now, after the lapse of three hundred years,
there may be many more refined and accomplished
women than Catharine was, for she was
not distinguished for learning or science; but
none exceed her in that pious, Christian disposition
which was so forcibly expressed in her
words and actions. Her lively temperament
and affectionate heart admirably qualified her
to feel the warmest sympathy in the diversified
events of her husband&rsquo;s life, and most kindly
to participate with him in his joys and sorrows.
But above all, it was not less her pious disposition
than her persevering faith which identified
her so completely with himself! Whenever the
opposition of the enemy disturbed the quiet of
the husband, Catharine never faltered for a
moment, and proceeded to administer consolation
to his dejected heart. During the prevalence
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
of a contagious disease, in 1527, her confidence
in God was not unshaken, so that Luther
could in truth write, &ldquo;Catharine is yet strong
in the faith.&rdquo; Also, as a widow, when she was
subject to attacks of sickness and adverse circumstances,
her equanimity never entirely
failed. She was especially solicitous about her
children, and devoted all the energies of body
and mind to their welfare. It cannot be denied
that Catharine partook of the common lot of
mortals; she had her faults and infirmities;
but they are all overshadowed by those
numerous exalted virtues which are not always
found united in one person of her sex. She
was a pattern of every domestic and Christian
virtue; of righteousness and good works to her
generation, and may the daughters and wives
of the present day imitate her example, and
profit by the practical lessons which her life
has taught!</p>
<p>If she could make no pretensions to personal
beauty, still she possessed not a little that was
attractive. She was of medium size, had an
oval face, a bright, sparkling eye, an expansive,
serene forehead, a nose rather small, lips a
little protruding, and cheek-bones somewhat
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
prominent. Erasmus speaks of her as a woman
of magnificent form and extraordinary beauty;
but Seckendorf says this is an extravagant
picture of her. The later opponents of Luther
agree with Erasmus in representing her as very
beautiful, and falsely charge the Reformer as
being attracted only by her personal charms.
Maimbourg says, &ldquo;Among the nuns, there was
one named Catharine von Bora, whom Luther
found to be very beautiful, and whom, on that
account, he loved.&rdquo; Varillas and Bossuet report,
&ldquo;That he married a nun of high rank and
uncommon beauty.&rdquo; Chardon de la Rochette
relates the following fact: &ldquo;I have found the
likeness of Luther and his wife in a lumber-room
in Orleans, where they are in great danger
of going to ruin. I will bet that there is
no man who would not wish to have so beautiful
a wife as Catharine von Bora. It is the first
time that I have seen her picture, and it justifies
the opinion which Bossuet has expressed
of her appearance. She has a noble, expressive,
and animated face.&rdquo; But Luther himself
says of her, &ldquo;A wife is sufficiently adorned and
beautiful when she pleases her husband, whom
she ought to please.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Her likeness was frequently painted, and
at various periods of her life, by the distinguished
artists of that age, such as Cranach,
senior, Cranach, junior, and Hans Holbein,
junior. Cranach, senior, painted her likeness
in oil colors <i>sixteen times</i>, and the other artists
mentioned, several times each. Many of these
original portraits are still to be seen in the
various picture galleries of Europe. There are
extant more than <i>forty</i> different copper-plate
and wood-engravings of her likeness. It has
also been transferred to porcelain-ware and
other articles of domestic use. A number of
medals containing her likeness have been struck
to commemorate her virtues, and plaster casts
of the bust of full life size have also been made.
All this shows the high esteem in which she has
ever been held by those who can appreciate
exalted virtue and genuine Christian character.</p>
<p>As a proof of her artistic skill and her proficiency
in ornamental needle-work, even in that
distant age, there is, to this day, exhibited in
the vestry-room of the cathedral at Merseburg,
a blue satin surplice which she embroidered for
her husband, and which he wore on the occasion
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
of some great solemnity, and in the former
University library at Wittenberg, they still
show a likeness of Luther, neatly and elegantly
worked in silk by Catharine. But these works
will perish, whilst the results of her faith, hope,
and charity, will endure forever.</p>

books, so that windows, chairs, benches, &amp;c. &amp;c., are

learned friends, as Melanchthon, Cruciger, Jonas,
Bugenhagen, and others. He submitted his work to
their review, and adopted such alterations as his judgment
approved. Various sections or books were published
from time to time, until finally, in 1534, the
complete Bible was published. His work superseded
all other previous translations, for it excelled them all
in fidelity, force, and distinctness; and even now, 300
years after its appearance, with all the modern progress
in criticism and biblical interpretation, and the improvements
of the German language which are displayed
in many more recent translations, Luther&rsquo;s Bible still
maintains the ascendency in private and public use.

wife, who cherished him so tenderly in sickness, &amp;c.
Whenever Dr. Luther was depressed, she, like a sensible
wife, always consulting his welfare, secretly invited Dr.
Jonas to her table, so that he might cheer him by his
interesting conversation. She knew that no one could
so well entertain him as Dr. Jonas.&rdquo;

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
